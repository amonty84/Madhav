  - Paksha Bala low (Krishna Paksha waxing phase)
net_resonance: "BENEFIC BUT D9-DEBILITATED — dharmic alignment compensates D9 weakness"
interpretive_note: "Relationships require dharmic framing and active structural effort. Saham Mahatmya (honor/fame) in 9H with Venus — the fame dimension is dharmic-spiritual, not career-only."
```

```yaml
element: "Mars Lagna-lord + PK + Avayogi in 7H enemy-sign"
domains_primary: [D3, D1, D4]

  - 2H = family/wealth/speech learning frontier
  - Rohini Pada 3 (high-craving intensification)
  - 5th aspect on 6H (Virgo) Mercury-sign — karmic lesson visible in 6H service domain
  - 9th aspect on 10H — ambition feeds career
  - Saham Roga in 2H Taurus (co-tenant with Rahu): health challenges emerge from 2H domain (speech, diet, Vata constitution) not from 7H relationship context
destructive_resonance:
  - Nodal-Moon-Rahu axis (Bhrigu Bindu from Moon+Rahu midpoint)
  - Rahu-Roga co-tenancy in 2H = Vata/nervous-system/diet health channel is Rahu-amplified
  - Rahu-Ketu axis amplifies both node-themes
net_resonance: "AMPLIFIED karmic-learning intensity in 2H material accumulation"
interpretive_note: "Rahu 2H = patient material-foundation as this-life curriculum. Saham Roga in 2H Taurus routes health challenges through the Vata-constitution-diet-speech channel, co-amplified by Rahu. Avoid speculation AND address dietary/Vata patterns."
```

net_resonance: "STRONGLY AMPLIFIED — hidden-pinnacle moksha architecture"
interpretive_note: "Ketu MD 2031-2038 is the chart's deepest authority activation. v2.0: Indu Lagna (Moon-based wealth indicator) confirmed in 8H Jyeshtha — wealth through transformation/hidden channels is an additional 8H theme."

```

### RM.11 — Arudha Lagna (AL) Capricorn 10H

```yaml
element: "AL at Capricorn 10H (co-location with Sun+Mercury stellium)"
domains_primary: [D1, D8]
msr_anchors: [MSR.023, MSR.019]
cdlm_anchors: [D1.D8=0.91]
constructive_resonance:
  - Projected-image = career-house = identity perceived as career
  - Co-location with Sun+Mercury = solar-authority + analytical-precision perception
  - Saturn 10th aspect (from 7H Libra) = Saturn-quality external perception
destructive_resonance:
  - Can produce excessive career-identity fusion; risk of over-identification with role
  - Saturn's heavy aspect adds gravitas but also rigidity
net_resonance: "STRONGLY AMPLIFIED — public identity fused with career"
interpretive_note: "The world sees what the career shows. Career shift = identity shift perceptually."

  - Hora Lagna in 3H Gemini (v2.0 confirmed) = annual-finance-power point in UL-house
destructive_resonance:
  - 3H effort/agitation house = spouse domain carries activity-intensity
  - Ardra-Pada overlay (Rahu-nakshatra) introduces karmic complication
net_resonance: "STRONGLY AMPLIFIED in 2026 BB-UL convergence window"
```

### RM.13 — 4H Cancer (Mother / Sanctuary / Varnada Lagna)

  - Mercury + Sun 7th aspect from 10H = analytical-solar light on sanctuary
  - Saturn 10th aspect from 7H = structural-discipline stabilizes sanctuary
  - Varnada Lagna in 4H Cancer (v2.0 corrected) = the 'path-activator' special lagna is in the emotional-home domain; Varnada in 4H suggests the path of dharmic activation runs through emotional-home grounding and maternal connection
  - Saham Vivaha in 4H Cancer (v2.0 confirmed) = marriage-saham in the home-sanctuary domain
destructive_resonance:
  - Mandi upagraha present (background Saturn-shadow malefic)
  - Lord Moon far in 11H = mother-significator displaced
  - Rank 8 Bhavabala (mid-low house strength)

    3. Bhrigu Bindu natal (fortune-timing sensitivity — natal 8°04')
    4. Shree Lagna in 7H Vishakha Pada 1 (Lakshmi-grace directly in relationship domain — new positive addition per v8.0)
    5. KP sub-lord = Saturn (relationship-house KP governance by the exalted AmK)
  - Bhavabala weakest (rank 12) but yoga-density strongest
  - Jaimini Rashi Drishti receives from Moon (Aquarius fixed-sign)
  - Shree Lagna in 7H: Lakshmi's grace-point now directly in the relationship domain = wealth-through-relationship dimension added to the 7H karmic vortex

  - Saham Mahatmya removed (now confirmed in 9H Sagittarius per v8.0 — not a 7H element)
net_resonance: "STRONGLY AMPLIFIED (yoga density, enhanced by Shree Lagna) AND TENSION-BEARING (fragile container)"
interpretive_note: "Chart's most yoga-dense relationship house. Five-layer convergence: Saturn exalted AmK + Mars Lagna lord PK + Bhrigu Bindu + Shree Lagna (Lakshmi's grace point) + KP sub-lord Saturn. The karmic vortex gains a Lakshmi-wealth dimension from Shree Lagna in 7H Libra — conscious relational investment is a direct wealth-activation mechanism. Tend deliberately with Saturn-discipline."

  - Bhavabala rank 3 (one of strongest houses)
  - Dual-sign-Saturn-lord (10L Saturn exalted 7H — Raja Yoga component)
destructive_resonance:
  - Saturn's own-sign rulership means career expresses through Saturnian structure (patient, slow)
net_resonance: "STRONGLY AMPLIFIED — chart's career delivery mechanism"

constructive_resonance:
  - In Libra 7H — Lakshmi's grace-point is in the RELATIONSHIP domain (not dharma house)
  - Vishakha Pada 1 (Jupiter-ruled pada of Indra-Agni nakshatra) = Lakshmi-via-Jupiter-quality
  - Co-tenant with Saturn exalted (AmK) and Mars (PK) = Lakshmi in the same house as the career-planet and children-significator
  - Co-location with natal Bhrigu Bindu (8°04' Libra) = destiny-sensitive point and Lakshmi-grace share the same location
  - Meaning: wealth materializes specifically THROUGH partnerships and relationships; collaborative enterprise is the Lakshmi channel
  - Relationships (7H) → Lakshmi-grace (Shree Lagna) → wealth (Venus 2L in 9H) = the wealth path runs through relational quality
destructive_resonance:
  - 7H BVB rank 12 = fragile container for Lakshmi's grace
  - Shree Lagna in enemy-sign of Venus (Libra is Saturn's sign; Venus rules Libra so this is Venus's own sign — actually BENEFIC; correction: Libra IS Venus's own sign, so this is a benefic placement for Shree Lagna)
net_resonance: "STRONGLY AMPLIFIED — wealth-through-relationship Lakshmi mechanism"
interpretive_note: "Lakshmi's grace routes through the RELATIONSHIP domain (7H Shree Lagna) — not through the dharma house. Wealth and Lakshmi are accessed via relationship quality, partnership investment, and collaborative enterprise. Conscious relational investment is a direct wealth-activation mechanism in this chart."

### RM.21A — Ghati Lagna 9H Sagittarius Purva Ashadha Pada 1 [v2.0 NEW — replaces old RM.21]

```yaml
element: "Ghati Lagna — temporal-power-timing lagna in 9H Sagittarius"
domains_primary: [D6, D1]
msr_anchors: [MSR.407]
cdlm_anchors: [D6.D1=0.89, D6.D6=0.94]
constructive_resonance:
  - Ghati Lagna in 9H Sagittarius = the lagna that marks peak temporal-power windows is in the dharma house
  - Co-tenant with Jupiter (own sign), Venus (Purva Ashadha) = Ghati Lagna receives maximum benefic support
  - Purva Ashadha Pada 1 (Sun-pada) = solar-authority quality to the power-timing
  - Classical: Ghati Lagna activation marks periods of heightened executive authority and social visibility
  - 9H placement means: peak power periods are accessed through dharmic/spiritual engagement, not through career aggression
destructive_resonance:
  - Ghati Lagna in a dual/mutable sign (Sagittarius) = power windows may be episodic rather than sustained
net_resonance: "STRONGLY AMPLIFIED — dharmic route to temporal power"
interpretive_note: "v2.0 NEW ELEMENT: Ghati Lagna confirmed in 9H Sagittarius per FORENSIC v8.0 (was incorrectly cited in 8H Scorpio in v1.1 RM.21). The power-timing lagna is in the dharma house — the native's windows of maximum temporal authority are triggered by dharmic alignment, not career-aggression. This is structurally coherent with Saturn = Dharma Devata = career-force. Ghati MD / Ghati-Lagna transit activations can be tracked for peak authority windows."
```

### RM.21B — Varnada Lagna 4H Cancer Pushya Pada 3 [v2.0 NEW — replaces old RM.21]

```yaml

domains_primary: [D7, D8, D6]
msr_anchors: [MSR.225]
cdlm_anchors: [D7.D8=0.72, D6.D4=0.80]
constructive_resonance:
  - Varnada Lagna in 4H Cancer = the lagna that indicates the native's path (varna/dharma-direction) is in the home-mother-emotional domain
  - Pushya Pada 3 (Saturn-pada) = emotional-home domain is structured and Saturn-governed
  - Classical: Varnada Lagna's sign indicates the native's core dharmic-professional orientation
  - 4H placement: the path of dharmic development runs through emotional security, home stability, and inner sanctuary cultivation
  - Saturn's 10th aspect on 4H from 7H = the career-planet also structures the Varnada domain
destructive_resonance:
  - Mandi in 4H = background malefic in the Varnada domain
  - 4H BVB rank 8 (mid-low)
net_resonance: "BENEFIC — emotional-home as dharmic path anchor"
interpretive_note: "v2.0 NEW ELEMENT: Varnada Lagna confirmed in 4H Cancer per FORENSIC v8.0 (was incorrectly cited in 8H Scorpio in v1.1 RM.21). The path-indicator lagna is in the home-emotional domain. The native's dharmic path is rooted in emotional foundation, home cultivation, and inner sanctuary — not in the transformation/hidden domain as previously thought. Mandi's presence in 4H is an obstacle within the very domain that holds the path-indicator; emotional security work is therefore not optional but structurally necessary."

constructive_resonance:
  - In Jupiter's sign (Pisces)
  - Mercury = Yogi Planet (Revati's lord)
  - 12H = foreign/moksha house
  - Ketu 5th aspect from 8H reaches 12H
  - Pranapada Lagna in 12H Pisces (confirmed v8.0) = life-breath also in fortune-moksha domain
destructive_resonance:
  - 12H SAV 23 (lowest in chart with Aquarius)
net_resonance: "STRONGLY AMPLIFIED — fortune-point in foreign/moksha domain"
interpretive_note: "Fortune crystallizes in foreign domain via Mercury activation. Singapore residence is Yogi-Point-activation. v2.0: Pranapada confirmed in 12H Pisces (consistent with v1.1)."

domains_primary: [D3, D6]
msr_anchors: [MSR.338, MSR.407]
cdlm_anchors: [D3.D6=0.86]
constructive_resonance:
  - Jupiter in own sign 9H casts full 7th aspect on 3H = UL house
  - Partnership-image domain receives dharma-lord's direct gaze
  - Jupiter = natural 9H benefic authority-on-dharma
  - Hora Lagna also in 3H (v2.0) = UL house now has Hora Lagna as additional benefic element alongside Jupiter's aspect
destructive_resonance:
  - Ardra nakshatra overlay on UL
net_resonance: "STRONGLY AMPLIFIED — dharmic partner-image"
interpretive_note: "Jupiter's 7th aspect from 9H lands on UL 3H Gemini. v2.0: Hora Lagna confirmed in 3H (not 7H as previously cited in CDLM v1.0) — the 3H partnership-communication domain now holds UL + Hora Lagna + Jupiter-Venus aspects simultaneously."

constructive_resonance:
  - Saturn exalted + Mars own-pada = both at high dignity levels despite conjunction
  - Orb 3°56' > 1° threshold (not Graha Yuddha)
  - Productive-tension mechanism classically described
destructive_resonance:
  - Natural enemies (Saturn's enemy = Mars)
  - Mars Avayogi compounds Saturn's structural heaviness
net_resonance: "TENSION-BEARING — chart's primary ATT engine"
interpretive_note: "Tension IS the mechanism. Attempting to 'resolve' it diminishes Saturn-authority. v2.0: D3.D3 anchor updated from 0.95 to 0.93."

constructive_resonance:
  - Soul's primary planet co-located with partner-image arudha
  - Aquarius = Saturn's sign (aligns with 10L Saturn career)
  - 11H = gains/social community
destructive_resonance:
  - Saturn-rulership introduces delay-temperament
net_resonance: "STRONGLY AMPLIFIED — soul-partnership structural alignment"

  - 8H = transformation, longevity, hidden depths, moksha gateway
  - Indu Lagna in 8H Jyeshtha (v2.0 confirmed per FORENSIC v8.0) = Moon-based wealth indicator in transformation house
  - Jyeshtha/Anuradha nakshatras bordering
destructive_resonance:
  - 8H classical shadow
  - [v2.0]: Varnada Lagna now confirmed in 4H Cancer (NOT 8H); Ghati Lagna confirmed in 9H Sagittarius (NOT 8H); 8H fourfold-stack from v1.1 corrected to threefold
net_resonance: "STRONGLY AMPLIFIED HIDDEN-PINNACLE (threefold stack)"
interpretive_note: "Chart's deepest-authority architecture. Ketu MD 2031-2038 activates this entire stack. v2.0: Varnada and Ghati Lagnas corrected out of 8H (both were wrong in v1.1 RM.21); 8H is now a cleaner Ketu-exalted + Indu Lagna stack — still the hidden-pinnacle domain but with a different lagna architecture than previously thought. The 8H's authority is Ketu-exalted + transformation-purification, not the compound of four special lagnas. Ketu MD 2031-2038 remains the activation window."

cdlm_anchors: [D6.D6=0.94]
constructive_resonance:
  - Aligns with hidden-pinnacle 8H architecture (Ketu exalted + Indu Lagna)
  - Moksha-karaka activates moksha-house themes
  - Ketu exalted natal → MD delivery at maximum dignity
  - Ghati Lagna (9H) and Varnada Lagna (4H) will be active dharmic-home dimensions during Ketu MD — these route through different domains than the 8H themes
destructive_resonance:
  - Mercury MD identity-investment must release (transition stress)
  - Double-nodal Ketu-Rahu AD in 2030-2031 (Rahu transit on natal Ketu) = nodal-intensity peak
net_resonance: "STRONGLY AMPLIFIED FUTURE — transformation-depth activation window"
interpretive_note: "Chart's central moksha-turn. Begin preparation in Ketu AD (2027-2028). v2.0: Ghati Lagna in 9H means Ketu MD dharmic-power windows activate through the dharma house; Varnada in 4H means the emotional-home domain also plays in Ketu MD's path-direction themes."

### RM.28 — Saraswati-Lakshmi-Raja Yoga Stack

```yaml

  - Lakshmi: Shree Lagna in 7H Libra + Venus 2L in 9H + Jupiter 9L in 9H (own-sign)
  - Lakshmi Yoga reinterpretation: Shree Lagna in 7H means Lakshmi-yoga activates through relationship channels, not directly through the 9H dharma domain; Venus 2L in 9H remains the direct wealth-dharma link
  - Raja Yoga 1: Jupiter 9L in own-sign 9H (Bhagya Yoga variant)
  - Raja Yoga 2: Sun 5L in 10H Kendra (classical Trikona-in-Kendra)
  - Raja Yoga 3: Saturn 10L exalted in 7H Kendra (Sasha Mahapurusha)

  - Saturn malefic-by-nature but fortune-delivering-by-chart
  - 7H weakest-container + highest-yoga-density (with Shree Lagna as new positive element per v2.0)
  - Jupiter own-sign but Uccha-Bala-weak
  - Aries Lagna fire-principle but career in Saturnian Capricorn
  - Venus D1-strong but D9-debilitated
  - Moon AK in gains-house (11H) not private-moksha house (12H)
destructive_resonance:
  - If native tries to resolve rather than hold tension, architecture underperforms
net_resonance: "TENSION-BEARING CURRICULUM"
interpretive_note: "Seven paired truths to hold simultaneously. Not errors. The curriculum IS the practice. v2.0: Seventh paradox (7H weakest + highest-yoga-density) now additionally contains Shree Lagna — the weakest container also holds Lakshmi's grace; this is the chart's most poignant paradox restatement."
