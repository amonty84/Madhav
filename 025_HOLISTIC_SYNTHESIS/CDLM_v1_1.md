# CDLM_v1_1 — Cross-Domain Linkage Matrix
## Abhisek Mohanty Jyotish Intelligence System
### v1.2 — Cross-Domain Linkage Matrix

### Purpose

The CDLM maps the structural interdependencies between the 9 life domains. Each cell (Row → Column) answers: "How does the Row domain structurally affect, feed, or constrain the Column domain in this native's chart?" This is not general astrology — every cell is grounded in specific MSR signals, CGM edges, and L1 facts.

The CDLM is the primary input to:
- UCN (Unified Chart Narrative) for domain-integration writing
- Domain Reports (L3) for cross-domain context
- Query interface (Phase 6) for multi-domain questions

### Nine Domains

| ID | Domain | Primary House | Primary Planet |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Career | 10H Capricorn | Saturn (AmK), Sun, Mercury |
| D2 | Wealth | 2H Taurus, 11H Aquarius | Rahu (2H), Moon (11H), Venus (2L) |
| D3 | Relationships | 7H Libra | Saturn (exalted), Mars, UL (3H) |
| D4 | Health | 6H Virgo, 8H Scorpio | Ketu (8H), Mandi (4H) |
| D5 | Children | 5H Leo | Jupiter (5L from Aries, = 12L... wait: from Aries Lagna, 5H = Leo; 5L = Sun; Jupiter = 9L+12L) |
| D6 | Spirit | 9H Sagittarius, 12H Pisces | Jupiter, Ketu, Yogi Point |
| D7 | Parents | 9H (father), 4H (mother) | Sun (pitru), Moon (matru), Jupiter (9H) |
| D8 | Mind | 4H Cancer, Moon | Moon (AK), Mercury (DK, intelligence) |
| D9 | Travel | 9H, 12H, 3H | Rahu (12H driver), Saham Paradesa (1H) |

### CDLM Schema (per cell)

```yaml
CDLM.Dx.Dy:
  row_domain: "source domain name"
  col_domain: "target domain name"
  linkage_type: [feeds | constrains | mirrors | amplifies | compensates | contradicts]
  primary_mechanism: "the specific astrological mechanism creating this linkage"
  msr_anchors: [list of MSR signal IDs most relevant]
  strength: 0.00-1.00  # how strong is this cross-domain link
  direction: [bidirectional | row→col | col→row]
  valence: [benefic | malefic | mixed | neutral]
  key_finding: "one-sentence distillation of the cross-domain relationship"
```

### Linkage Type Definitions

- **feeds**: Domain A's activities directly produce inputs to Domain B (e.g., career produces wealth)
- **constrains**: Domain A's state limits or shapes what Domain B can achieve
- **mirrors**: Domain A reflects the same underlying planetary energy as Domain B (same planet governs both)
- **amplifies**: When Domain A is active, Domain B's results are magnified
- **compensates**: Domain A's weakness is offset by Domain B's strength
- **contradicts**: Domain A and Domain B are in structural tension in this chart

### Directional Asymmetry Convention (added 2026-04-18 FIX_SESSION_002)

CDLM cells can carry asymmetric strengths across the diagonal — i.e., `CDLM.Dx.Dy.strength` ≠ `CDLM.Dy.Dx.strength` for some pairs. This is by design, not error. The asymmetry reflects genuine mechanistic differences in directional flow:

- `Dx → Dy` strength quantifies how strongly the row-domain influences the column-domain
- `Dy → Dx` strength quantifies the reverse flow
- These can legitimately differ when the underlying mechanism is asymmetric

**Example**: CDLM.D1.D2 (Career → Wealth) = 0.92; CDLM.D2.D1 (Wealth → Career) = 0.88. Career drives wealth more directly than wealth drives career — the asymmetry captures the primacy of the Career→Wealth mechanism in this chart.

**Reading convention**:
- If `direction: row→col` on both sides (D1.D2 and D2.D1), the cells are two independent directional links, not redundant
- If `direction: bidirectional`, strengths should be identical (any divergence indicates transcription error)
- 27 of 36 off-diagonal pairs exhibit asymmetry in this CDLM (Δ ∈ [0.01, 0.06]) per AUDIT_REPORT_v1_0 WS-3a

**Validation**: CONTRADICTION_REGISTRY §5 (as of 2026-04-18) lists the specific asymmetric pairs. Future CDLM v2.0 may normalize to strict symmetry if practitioners prefer, but v1.1 preserves directional fidelity.

**Legend**: → = row feeds col (directional) | ↔ = bidirectional | ✓ = self-reference

**v1.1 changes from v1.0**: D3.D3: 0.95→0.93; D3.D4: 0.76→0.68; D4.D3: 0.78↔→0.61→; D6.D2: 0.88→0.84→; D6.D6: 0.96→0.94

### Highest-Strength Cross-Domain Links (≥0.88)

1. **Mind → Career (0.94)**: Mercury in 10H = mind IS career
2. **Mind → Mind (0.95)**: Mercury eight-system (v8.0) + Moon-AK double-mind resource
3. **Spirit → Spirit (0.94)**: Six confirmed spiritual mechanisms self-amplifying
4. **Relationships → Relationships (0.93)**: 7H five-layer convergence
5. **Career → Career (1.00)**: Chart's primary domain = self-organizing apex
6. **Mind → Wealth (0.92)**: Mercury Yogi = mental excellence = financial gains
7. **Career → Wealth (0.92)**: AL in 10H = career reputation drives wealth
8. **Wealth → Relationships (0.89)**: Venus as 2L+7L = same energy; Shree Lagna in 7H adds Lakshmi-grace
9. **Career → Spirit (0.89)**: Palana Devata = Mercury = career IS dharmic practice
10. **Travel → Career (0.90)**: Singapore move = career-defining travel

### Lowest-Strength Cross-Domain Links (≤0.62)

1. **Children → Health (0.58)**: Weak secondary link through adjacent houses
2. **Children → Travel (0.60)**: Structural competition for 9H energy
3. **Health → Travel (0.60)**: Mild 6H-12H axis constraint
4. **Health → Relationships (0.61)**: Indirect via Saturn Sade Sati + Venus dual-role
5. **Relationships → Parents (0.62)**: Mild parental-proximity constraint

### Structural Reading: The Chart's Primary Flow

**Primary current**: Career ← → Mind ← → Wealth (0.94, 0.92, 0.92) = the career-mind-wealth triangle is the chart's primary energy loop; all three domains feed each other with ≥0.92 strength

**Secondary current**: Spirit ← → Career ← → Travel → Wealth = the spiritual-career-travel-wealth chain explains the native's entire adult life architecture (dharmic career in a foreign land producing wealth)

**Karmic vortex**: Relationships (0.93 self-amplifying, five-layer) = the 7H five-layer convergence means relationship-karma is the chart's deepest karmic processing zone; Shree Lagna in 7H adds a wealth-through-relationship channel to the karmic vortex

**Generational axis**: Parents → Spirit → Children = the dharmic generational chain; parental wisdom (9H) feeds spiritual practice (9H same house) which seeds children's purva punya (5H)

**v1.1 structural revision**: Health→Relationships link reduced from 0.78 mirror to 0.61 constrains (unidirectional); the 7H karmic vortex is now primarily Saturn+Mars+Bhrigu Bindu+Shree Lagna+KP rather than the previously assumed Hora Lagna+Roga/Mahatmya configuration; Shree Lagna's move from 9H to 7H strengthens D2↔D3 (wealth-relationship fusion) while reducing D6.D2 (spirit→wealth directness)
