# GCS Layout — MARSYS Source Buckets

## Overview

Two GCS buckets form the MARSYS storage foundation, both in region `asia-south1` (co-located with Cloud SQL `amjis-postgres` in `madhav-astrology:asia-south1`).

| Bucket | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `gs://madhav-marsys-sources` | L1, L2.5, L3 source artifacts — authoring source-of-truth mirror | CURRENT (live since Phase 14A) |
| `gs://madhav-marsys-build-artifacts` | Pipeline outputs, processed embeddings, build reproducibility | CURRENT (live since Phase 14A) |

**Versioning convention:** filenames carry version strings (e.g., `MSR_v3_0.md`). GCS object versioning is enabled on both buckets, preserving the history of every overwrite within a given path. Do not increment GCS paths for version bumps — overwrite in place; prior versions are retrievable via GCS object versioning.

## `gs://madhav-marsys-sources` — Source Artifact Bucket

### Properties

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Storage class | STANDARD |
| Region | asia-south1 |
| Object versioning | ENABLED (every overwrite preserved — audit trail) |
| Lifecycle — versions | No deletion (source history is legally important) |
| Public access prevention | enforced |
| Uniform bucket-level access | enabled |
| Labels | `purpose=marsys-l1-l25-l3-sources`, `env=prod` |

### IAM

| Principal | Role | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `marsys-pipeline-writer@madhav-astrology.iam.gserviceaccount.com` | `roles/storage.objectCreator` | Sources bucket only — write, no delete |
| `marsys-runtime-reader@madhav-astrology.iam.gserviceaccount.com` | `roles/storage.objectViewer` | Sources bucket only — read only |

**Notes:**
- `L1/ephemeris/` paths are reserved; files don't exist locally yet (coverage gaps). The sync script skips non-existent files.
- L3 `.md` companion files exist on disk alongside `.json` registry entries; both are included in the sync per this layout.
- L2 (`02_ANALYTICAL_LAYER/`) is formally archived — NOT included in this bucket. Archived per Phase 14F.
- L4 does not exist (single-native; federated discovery is M3+ work).
- L5 (`06_LEARNING_LAYER/`) is not included in this bucket in Phase 14A. Learning Layer sync scope is a separate decision.

## `gs://madhav-marsys-build-artifacts` — Build Artifact Bucket

### Properties

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Storage class | STANDARD (first 90 days) → NEARLINE (after 90 days) |
| Region | asia-south1 |
| Object versioning | ENABLED |
| Lifecycle — class transition | STANDARD → NEARLINE after 90 days |
| Lifecycle — noncurrent version deletion | Delete noncurrent versions older than 365 days |
| Public access prevention | enforced |
| Uniform bucket-level access | enabled |
| Labels | `purpose=marsys-build-pipeline-output`, `env=prod` |

### IAM

| Principal | Role | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `marsys-pipeline-writer@madhav-astrology.iam.gserviceaccount.com` | `roles/storage.objectAdmin` | Artifacts bucket — full control of objects |

### Intended Layout (populated by Phase 14B+)

```
gs://madhav-marsys-build-artifacts/
└── runs/
    └── <build-run-id>/
        ├── embeddings/
        │   └── *.json          ← chunk embeddings produced by rag pipeline
        ├── chunks/
        │   └── *.json          ← chunked source documents
        └── manifest.json       ← build manifest: source hashes, config, timestamps
```

This layout is defined in Phase 14B (Build Pipeline). The bucket exists now to receive those outputs.

---

## Naming Conventions

1. **Source file names** carry the artifact version in the filename (`_v3_0`, `_v1_2`, etc.). Do not create version-less paths for versioned artifacts.
2. **GCS path = layer prefix + flat filename**. No subdirectory nesting beyond the layout above.
3. **Object versioning** is the history mechanism — do not create parallel `_old`, `_backup` objects. Overwrite in place.
4. **Build artifact paths** always include a `<build-run-id>` component for isolation. Runs are immutable once written.

---

## Transition Status (Phase 14A → 14C)

The CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.json entries for CURRENT assets now carry both `path` (local filesystem) and `gcs_uri` fields, with `status: TRANSITIONAL`. The platform runtime (`platform/src/`) still reads from local paths until Phase 14C cuts over to GCS reads. The transition flips `TRANSITIONAL → CURRENT` and removes the local-path dependency from the runtime.

*End GCS_LAYOUT_v1_0.md. Governed by Phase 14A; updated at each phase that modifies bucket structure.*
