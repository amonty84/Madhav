role: >
  Machine-readable, single-file "you-are-here" pointer for the MARSYS-JIS project. Answers —
  in one grep — the question a fresh session asks: which macro-phase is active, which
  phase-plan row is in flight, which governance step is ready, which session last closed,
  and what the next session is committed to. Updated at every session close.
implements: >
  GROUNDING_AUDIT_v1_0.md GA.19 (you-are-here marker, full-surface layer — Step 0 installed
  a minimal STEP_LEDGER pointer; Step 10 upgrades to this proper state file per §I.5 of the
  governance integrity protocol). Companion to SESSION_LOG_SCHEMA_v1_0.md which closes
  GA.17 + GA.18 at the entry-format layer.
supersedes: >
  The ad-hoc "you are here" prose previously living in CLAUDE.md §F and in
  `.gemini/project_state.md` §"Governance Rebuild In Progress". Those surfaces remain, but
  post-Step-10 they should CITE this file rather than DUPLICATE its fields. CLAUDE.md §F +
  §C item #8 are updated in this same Step 10 session with single-line pointers to this
  file (protocol §M.1 P5 minimal-edit rule). Full CLAUDE.md migration to cite-CURRENT_STATE-
  by-reference lands at Step 15 (GOVERNANCE_BASELINE_v1_0) close per the rebuild-era banner's
  "this banner is replaced with a steady-state pointer to CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md" clause.
mirror_obligations:
  claude_side: 00_ARCHITECTURE/CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md
  gemini_side: ".gemini/project_state.md — state-block + Governance Rebuild section reflect the same fields (MP.2 composite mirror)"
  mirror_mode: adapted_parity_state
  authoritative_side: claude
  mirror_pair_id: "MP.2 (composite — CURRENT_STATE joins SESSION_LOG + STEP_LEDGER + active plan pointers on the Claude side)"
  asymmetries: >
    Claude-side is a single canonical YAML block (this file's §2) plus a narrative §3.
    Gemini-side is free-form Gemini-idiom prose in .gemini/project_state.md §"Governance
    Rebuild In Progress" + §"Canonical Corpus State". Semantic parity, not byte-identity.
    Post-Step-15, both sides update their banners to reflect "rebuild closed"; this file
    remains LIVE while the project runs.
update_rules: >
  Every session-close checklist (SESSION_CLOSE_TEMPLATE_v1_0.md §2) updates this file as
  part of the atomic close. The close checklist's `current_state_updated: true` field
  affirms the update happened. Pre-Step-10 sessions carry `current_state_updated: n/a`
  per the template's rebuild-era convention; post-Step-10 sessions flip this to `true`.
  Post-Step-15, `step_ledger_updated` is dropped from the close-checklist; only
  `current_state_updated` remains as the state-transition field.
consumers:
  - CLAUDE.md §F + §C item #8 — cite this file as the primary you-are-here surface
  - .geminirules §F + §C item #8 (MP.1 mirror of the Claude-side citations)
  - .gemini/project_state.md — reflects CURRENT_STATE fields in Gemini-idiom prose (MP.2)
  - platform/scripts/governance/schema_validator.py — `validate_current_state()` added in
    Step 10 checks required fields present + cross-checks against STEP_LEDGER (during
    rebuild era) and SESSION_LOG (always)
  - platform/scripts/governance/drift_detector.py — verifies CURRENT_STATE fields agree
    with STEP_LEDGER's current `ready`/`in_progress` row and SESSION_LOG's latest
    `session_close.session_id`
  - Every session-close checklist from Step 10 onward
changelog:
  - v3.5 (2026-05-02, PHASE_O_S0_1_OBSERVATORY_GOVERNANCE_BOOTSTRAP):
    **Phase O Observatory concurrent workstream OPENED.** Gate session S0.1
    closed; OBSERVATORY_PLAN_v1_0.md authored as a concurrent workstream
    governance plan alongside the main M5 INCOMING thread. Five deliverables:
    (1) `00_ARCHITECTURE/OBSERVATORY_PLAN_v1_0.md` v1.0.0 NEW CURRENT
    (10 sections; 30-session O.0–O.4 sub-phase decomposition; two-layer
    telemetry + reconciliation ledger over five providers Anthropic / OpenAI
    / Gemini / DeepSeek / NIM; 5-table data model; wall-clock projections
    4-way / 8-way concurrency; Phase O close acceptance criteria 12 items;
    risks + open decisions deferred to native).
    (2) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.json` v2.5 → v2.6
    (OBSERVATORY_PLAN_v1_0 entry registered as L_GOVERNANCE class;
    entry_count 138 → 139; manifest_fingerprint extended
    `+phase_o_s0_1_observatory_plan_2026-05-02`; last_updated_by →
    PHASE_O_S0_1_OBSERVATORY_GOVERNANCE_BOOTSTRAP).
    (3) `00_ARCHITECTURE/manifest_overrides.yaml` MP.9 mirror pair declared
    (OBSERVATORY_PLAN ↔ Gemini-side concurrent-workstream summary block in
    `.geminirules §E` + `.gemini/project_state.md`; mirror_mode
    adapted_parity_summary; authoritative_side claude; declared_at_session
    PHASE_O_S0_1_OBSERVATORY_GOVERNANCE_BOOTSTRAP).
    (4) CURRENT_STATE v3.4 → v3.5 (this update). New
    `concurrent_workstreams:` field added to §2 with `phase_o_observatory`
    block (active_since: 2026-05-02; gate_session: S0.1; gate_status: closed;
    plan_artifact: 00_ARCHITECTURE/OBSERVATORY_PLAN_v1_0.md; next_sessions:
    "parallel-safe per OBSERVATORY_PLAN §5"; branch:
    feature/phase-o-observatory). Canonical pointers `active_macro_phase`
    M5 / `active_macro_phase_status` incoming / `last_session_id` /
    `next_session_objective` UNCHANGED — Phase O is a CONCURRENT WORKSTREAM
    not the main thread; main thread state continues from v3.4 (M4 CLOSED;
    M5 INCOMING). Only `file_updated_at` and `file_updated_by_session`
    rotated to S0.1 timestamps. `red_team_counter` UNCHANGED at 0
    (concurrent-workstream gate session; not a main-thread substantive
    session for IS.8(a) cadence purposes).
    (5) `00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_LOG.md` PHASE_O_S0_1 entry appended per
    SESSION_CLOSE_TEMPLATE format (open + body + close atomic append).
    Mirror MP.1 + MP.2 + MP.9 propagated this session: `.geminirules §E`
    Concurrent workstreams updated with Phase O block; `.gemini/project_state.md`
    Phase O concurrent-workstream section appended. Schema_validator,
    drift_detector, mirror_enforcer all run at close. No DR entries opened.
    Branch: feature/phase-o-observatory (umbrella; sub-branches per session
    past S0.1 per PHASE_O_CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPTS.md).
  - v3.4 (2026-05-02, M4-D-S1): **M4 MACRO-PHASE CLOSED.** Single-session
    substantive close-class session sealing the M4 macro-phase. Eight
    substantive deliverables: (1) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/M4_CLOSE_v1_0.md` v1.0
    NEW (CLOSED; sealing artifact for M4 macro-phase; six sections per
    execution brief — §1 LL.1–LL.7 outcomes + §2 NAP.M4.1–7 registry + §3
    carry-forward roster with final dispositions + §4 IS.8(b) RT.1–RT.5
    verdicts PASS 5/5 + §5 M5 setup recommendations 8 items + §6 known
    asymmetries). (2) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.json` v2.4 →
    v2.5 (M4_CLOSE_v1_0 entry registered; entry_count 137 → 138; manifest_
    fingerprint extended `+m4_d_s1_close_2026-05-02`; last_updated_by →
    M4-D-S1; Python json.load() parse-clean verified — 138 entries /
    manifest_version 2.5). Coordinated with parallel session M4-D-P1-CDLM-
    PATCH which had bumped manifest to v2.4 — this M4-D-S1 takes v2.5 per
    "current+1" parallel-coordination convention. (3) CURRENT_STATE v3.3 →
    v3.4 (this update). Canonical state pointers ROTATED per W6 brief:
    `active_macro_phase` M4 → M5 (M4 CLOSED / M5 INCOMING); `active_macro_
    phase_status` active → closed (M4 sealed); `active_phase_plan_status`
    active → COMPLETE (PHASE_M4_PLAN_v1_0.md SUPERSEDED-AS-COMPLETE);
    `last_session_id` → M4-D-S1; `next_session_objective` rewritten →
    "M5-S1: open M5 macro-phase; read MACRO_PLAN §M5 scope; draft
    PHASE_M5_PLAN_v1_0.md"; `active_phase_plan_sub_phase` rewritten with

    of M4_CLOSE_v1_0.md per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G; same convention
    as M4-B-S6/M4-C-S4 sub-phase closes); `file_updated_at` rotated to
    2026-05-02T22:00:00+05:30; `file_updated_by_session` → M4-D-S1;
    `cross_check_hash` updated (tuple now: active_governance_step still
    Step_15 completed; last_session_id M4-D-S1; next_governance_step still
    null); `predraft_available` block CLEARED (PHASE_M4D_PLAN_v1_0.md
    CONSUMED at this session — status flipped DRAFT → CLOSED via W7);
    `parallel_session_notes` block rewritten reflecting M4-D-S1 + M4-D-P1
    cumulative coordination (M4-D-P1 substrate patch CDLM v1.2→v1.3
    landed; M4-D-S1 macro-phase close landed; both v3.3+v3.4 audit-trailed).
    (4) `00_ARCHITECTURE/PHASE_M4D_PLAN_v1_0.md` status DRAFT → CLOSED (W7;
    frontmatter status flip + v1.0 CLOSED changelog entry recording M4-D-S1
    discharge + 10 work items completed). (5) `00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_LOG.md`
    M4-D-S1 entry appended per SESSION_CLOSE_TEMPLATE format with all
    files_modified, red_team_result summary, NAP.M4.7 verdict, carry-forward
    final dispositions, commit hashes (W8). (6) Carry-forward final
    dispositions recorded per W2: CF.LL7.1 = CLOSED_PARALLEL (M4-D-P1 patch
    in flight per v3.3 changelog above; expected to reduce 8 MED-tier
    sanity-anchor `novel` → `confirmed` count when LL.7 re-emits in M5);
    KR.M4A.RT.LOW.1 = DEFERRED (commit 0793719 malformed root tree; carry
    to M5 hygiene); R.LL1TPA.1 = FINAL_NOT_REACHABLE (Gemini unreachable
    across all M4 sessions; M5 entry re-attempt obligation persists per
    LL1_TWO_PASS_APPROVAL §5.5); GAP.M4A.04 = PARTIAL_CLOSE_ACCEPTED
    (carry to M5 LEL maintenance). (7) **NAP.M4.7 verdict APPROVED
    (pre-decided per execution brief);** AC.D1.6 hard stop BYPASSED.
    (8) IS.8(b) macro-phase-close red-team conducted in-document §4 of
    M4_CLOSE — verdict PASS 5/5 axes (RT.1 LL.N computation discharge;

    Mirror sync MP.1+MP.2: NOT propagated this session — brief may_touch

    Red-team: IS.8(b) macro-phase-close cadence DISCHARGED in-document §4
    of M4_CLOSE_v1_0.md (RT.1–RT.5 PASS 5/5 axes 0 findings). Counter

    sub-phase closes extended to macro-phase-close granularity). Next
    IS.8(a) every-third cadence-fires at counter=3 (three substantive
    sessions hence — likely deep into M5). Next IS.8(b) macro-phase-close
    cadence at M5 close. Next §IS.8(c) every-12-months MACRO_PLAN review

    Validator outcomes: schema_validator.py to be re-run at session close

    increases). drift_detector.py + mirror_enforcer.py NOT re-run (out of
    W10 scope — schema validation only per execution brief).
  - v3.3 (2026-05-02, M4-D-P1-CDLM-PATCH): **CF.LL7.1 CLOSED — CDLM Pancha-MP
    msr_anchors patch.** Parallel-slot governance-aside session running alongside
    M4-D-S1 (M4 macro-phase close — not yet landed). Per brief
    `CURRENT_STATE_VERSION_TAKE: read CURRENT_STATE; your version = that version
    + 1 (parallel slot)` this session takes v3.3 (S4 took v3.2; P1 takes v3.3).
    Canonical state pointers PRESERVED per brief AC.P1.7 hard_constraint:
    `last_session_id` remains `M4-C-S4-CLOSE`; `next_session_objective` remains
    `M4-D-S1`; `active_governance_step`, `active_phase_plan`, `active_macro_phase`
    all unchanged. `active_phase_plan_sub_phase` text augmented with the M4-D-P1
    CF.LL7.1 closure note (does not rotate the sub-phase pointer — M4-D remains
    INCOMING; P1 is a CDLM substrate patch, not a sub-phase advance).
    `red_team_counter` UNCHANGED at 0 (governance-aside / parallel-slot class per
    `ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G` discharge-of-cadence-class precedent —
    surgical msr_anchors patch + frontmatter version bump + manifest +
    CURRENT_STATE + SESSION_LOG; no engine, no retrieval, no synthesis, no
    learning-layer compute; same convention as M4-C-P7-M4D-ENTRY-PREP and
    M4-B-P1-GAP-TRAVEL-CLOSE governance asides). `file_updated_at` rotated to
    2026-05-02T20:30:00+05:30; `file_updated_by_session` → M4-D-P1-CDLM-PATCH;
    `cross_check_hash` UNCHANGED (tuple unchanged: active_governance_step still
    Step_15 completed; last_session_id still M4-C-S4-CLOSE; next_governance_step
    still null). `predraft_available` PRESERVED (PHASE_M4D_PLAN_v1_0.md still
    pending consumption at M4-D-S1). `parallel_session_notes` block rewritten
    to reflect M4-D-P1 in flight (S4 single-track block from v3.2 preserved as
    audit trail).
    Substantive deliverables (within brief may_touch only):
    (1) `025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/CDLM_v1_1.md` MODIFIED — CF.LL7.1 Pancha-MP
        msr_anchors patch per brief AC.P1.2/AC.P1.3. Append-only edits to four
        msr_anchors arrays (no reorder; no edge_weight/confirmed_count/other-field
        touch): MSR.117 (Saturn/Sasha-Kendra-yoga) appended to CDLM.D1.D1
        msr_anchors → `[MSR.390, MSR.413, MSR.339, MSR.349, MSR.117]`;
        MSR.118 (Venus/Malavya-yoga) appended to CDLM.D5.D5 → `[MSR.333,
        MSR.341, MSR.118]`; MSR.119 (Mars/Ruchaka-yoga) appended to CDLM.D5.D6
        → `[MSR.333, MSR.341, MSR.406, MSR.119]`; MSR.143 (Jupiter/Hamsa-yoga)
        appended to CDLM.D5.D7 → `[MSR.394, MSR.407, MSR.143]`. AC.P1.4 grep
        verification PASS — MSR.117/118/119/143 each appear at least once in
        their respective cells' msr_anchors. Frontmatter version bumped 1.2 →
        1.3 (NOT 1.1 → 1.2 as brief AC.P1.5 prescribed; per OPEN_NOTE.P1.2 the
        file's actual current internal version was already 1.2 from a 2026-04-19
        corpus cleanup pass — patch took next clean version 1.3 to honor B.8
        versioning discipline; brief author appears to have read pre-2026-04-19
        state); status remains CURRENT; v1_3_changelog field added documenting
        the patch + OPEN_ITEM.P1.1 note + version-discrepancy note. Title bumped
        `### v1.2 — Cross-Domain Linkage Matrix` → `### v1.3 — Cross-Domain
        Linkage Matrix`. New file sha256 = `21443a36f9e11f1a055c5c9b6ac42c
        006321e9acfc5f3de5f2fb1bc5940273be`.
    (2) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.json` MODIFIED — CDLM_v1_1 entry
        version "1.2" → "1.3"; fingerprint rotated to new sha256 (above);
        `last_modified: 2026-05-02` field added to the entry per brief AC.P1.6
        (entry previously had no last_modified field — added rather than mutated
        in-place per interpretive faithful execution; manifest top-level fields
        already track update timestamps). Top-level: manifest_version "2.3" →
        "2.4"; manifest_fingerprint extended `+m4d_p1_cdlm_patch_2026-05-02`;
        last_updated 2026-05-02 (unchanged); last_updated_by `M4-C-S4-CLOSE`
        → `M4-D-P1-CDLM-PATCH`. entry_count UNCHANGED at 137 (no new entries;
        only existing CDLM_v1_1 entry modified). Python json.load() parse-clean
        verified (137 entries; manifest_version 2.4; CDLM version 1.3;
        fingerprint correct).
    (3) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md` v3.2 → v3.3 (this update).
        See state-pointer preservation + freshness rotation discussion above.
    (4) `00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_LOG.md` MODIFIED — M4-D-P1-CDLM-PATCH entry
        appended per brief AC.P1.8 + SESSION_CLOSE_TEMPLATE format.
    Read-only consumed: CLAUDE.md (project instructions; §C items 1–11);
    025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/CLAUDE.md (L2.5 layer instructions); 00_ARCHITECTURE/
    CLAUDE.md (architecture folder instructions); CURRENT_STATE v3.2 §2 canonical

    D5.D7 (full file scanned for Mercury Bhadra cell + MSR.117/118/119/143/145
    pre-existing presence — all five MSR signals confirmed absent from
    msr_anchors before patch); SESSION_LOG.md M4-C-S4-CLOSE entry tail (entry-
    format reference). Out-of-scope (per brief must_not_touch): `06_LEARNING_LAYER/
    SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/signal_weights/**` (LL.7 JSON outputs frozen — patch
    corrects substrate for future runs only; does NOT retroactively alter M4-C
    artifacts per HARD CONSTRAINT); `01_FACTS_LAYER/**`; `platform/**`; any
    L2.5 file other than CDLM_v1_1.md (UCN/CGM/MSR/RM untouched). Scope honored.
    Open items / disagreements:
      - **OPEN_ITEM.P1.1 (Mercury Bhadra cell absent from CDLM).** Per brief
        AC.P1.2 NOTE on MSR.145: identification step ran. CDLM is structurally
        a 9×9 domain-pair matrix (CDLM.Dx.Dy where x,y ∈ {D1..D9} = Career,
        Wealth, Relationships, Health, Children, Spirit, Parents, Mind, Travel)
        — there are no planet-specific cells of any kind. No cell named
        "Mercury", "Bhadra", or any analogue exists; full-file grep for
        "Bhadra" returns only Moon-nakshatra Purva-Bhadrapada incidental hits
        in cell narratives (irrelevant to Mercury Bhadra-yoga). MSR.145 cannot
        be anchored at this surgical pass per brief HARD CONSTRAINT
        "Do NOT create new CDLM cells." OPEN_ITEM.P1.1 carried to M5 CDLM
        expansion pass per brief AC.P1.2 explicit fall-through clause
        ("Mercury Bhadra cell absent from CDLM; MSR.145 cannot be anchored;
        carry to M5 CDLM expansion pass").
      - **OPEN_NOTE.P1.2 (CDLM version-discrepancy with brief).** Brief AC.P1.5
        prescribed `v1.1 → v1.2`; file was already at internal v1.2 from a
        2026-04-19 corpus cleanup pass (v1_2_changelog: "Corrective text
        stripped 2026-04-19 per corpus cleanup brief"); patch took next
        clean increment v1.2 → v1.3 to honor B.8 versioning discipline.
        Brief intent (substantive version bump with new changelog entry
        capturing CF.LL7.1 patch) honored at v1.3 instead of v1.2. Manifest
        CDLM entry version was also already "1.2" — bumped to "1.3" to match.
        No semantic divergence from brief; only the version-number identifier
        differs. NOT a blocker; recorded for transparency.
      - **OPEN_NOTE.P1.3 (cell-id parenthetical mismatch).** Brief AC.P1.2
        labels the four target cells with planet/yoga parentheticals — D1.D1
        "(Saturn / Sasha-Kendra)", D5.D5 "(Venus / Malavya)", D5.D6
        "(Mars / Ruchaka)", D5.D7 "(Jupiter / Hamsa)". The CDLM cells these
        IDs designate are domain-pair cells: D1.D1 = Career → Career;
        D5.D5 = Children → Children; D5.D6 = Children → Spirit;
        D5.D7 = Children → Parents. The parenthetical labels in the brief
        do not match the actual CDLM cell semantics (which are domain-pair,
        not planet-specific). Patch followed the literal cell-ID → MSR-ID
        mapping the brief specifies; the planet/yoga parentheticals are
        treated as analytical labels reflecting the brief author's mechanistic
        rationale (e.g., D1.D1 Career-self = Saturn-AmK in 7H = Sasha-Kendra-yoga
        is mechanistically operative for Career-self-reference; analogous
        rationales for D5.D5/D5.D6/D5.D7 may exist but are not surfaced in
        the brief). NOT a blocker; recorded for downstream M5 CDLM expansion
        review (whether the cell-yoga rationale should be elaborated in
        cell key_finding text or relocated to different cells).
    Mirror sync MP.1+MP.2: NOT propagated this session — small surgical patch
    + parallel-slot governance-aside class; brief may_touch does not include
    `.geminirules` or `.gemini/project_state.md`; deferred to next substantive
    close that already touches mirror surfaces (likely M4-D-S1 close per
    PHASE_M4D_PLAN). DIS.class.mirror_desync window: NOT opened — patch is a
    pure substrate change with no Gemini-side state implication; the
    cumulative S4→P1 delta (CDLM v1.2→v1.3, manifest v2.3→v2.4) carries
    forward to M4-D-S1 mirror sync.
    Red-team: NOT conducted this session — governance-aside / parallel-slot
    class per `ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G`; counter unchanged at 0; next
    IS.8(a) every-third-session cadence-fires at counter=3 (three substantive
    sessions hence — likely M4-D-S1 + two M4-D follow-ups).
    Validator outcomes: schema_validator.py to be re-run post-commit per
    brief AC.P1.10 (baseline 108 violations target; halt-and-report if count
    increases). drift_detector.py + mirror_enforcer.py NOT re-run (out of
    P1 scope — neither lives in P1 may_touch; both remain at last-known
    BASELINE/CLEAN per M4-C-S2/S3/S4 verifications).
  - v3.2 (2026-05-02, M4-C-S4-CLOSE): **M4-C SUB-PHASE CLOSED.** Sub-phase
    close-class substantive session sealing M4_C_CLOSE_v1_0.md DRAFT → CLOSED;
    in-document IS.8(b)-class M4-C sub-phase-close red-team conducted per
    PHASE_M4C_PLAN §3.4 AC.M4C.S4.3 (5 axes, PASS, 0 CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/
    NOTE/INFO new findings). Sequential after M4-C-S3 (single-track) and parallel-
    safe with the M4-C-P7-M4D-ENTRY-PREP governance slot which took v3.1 with
    canonical pointers UNCHANGED — this S4 close reads live v3.1 state and adapts
    to v3.2 per "current+1" operational rule.
    Substantive deliverables (within may_touch only):
    (1) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/M4_C_CLOSE_v1_0.md` v1.0
        DRAFT → CLOSED — sealed by resolving every `[PENDING-S*]` token against
        actual S1/S2/S3 outcomes read from sealed shadow registers + design docs +
        NAP_M4_6_BRIEF v1.2 + CURRENT_STATE v2.7→v2.8→v2.9→v3.0→v3.1 changelog

        CDLM construction. §1.2 sub-phase rounds populated with all 5 sessions
        (S1 + P6 + S2 + S3 + S4). §2 ACs: PHASE_M4_PLAN §3.3 AC.M4C.1–5 = 5/5
        PASS; per-sub-phase ACs S1.1–S4.5 PASS with 2 informational deferrals
        (LL.3 fix-before-prod → M4-D; stability-gate convention → informational);
        per-session brief ACs S1.1–S1.7 + S2.1–S2.7 + S3.1–S3.9 + S4.1–S4.9 =
        32/32 PASS. §3 deliverables fully populated. §5 LL status fully populated
        (LL.5 380 signals tier breakdown; LL.6 H2 rejected; LL.7 243 edges with
        sanity 8/8 novel PASS). §6 residuals: §6.1 9 substrate items; §6.2 10
        inherited items; §6.3+§6.4 unchanged; CF.LL7.1 NEW; F.M4CS3.MIRROR.1 +

        this S4. §7.2 in-document IS.8(b)-class red-team verdict PASS 5/5 axes.
        §8 approval populated. §9 v1.0 SEAL changelog entry.
    (2) `00_ARCHITECTURE/MACRO_PLAN_v2_0.md` v2.0 → v2.1 — DECISION-1 propagation
        (R.LL5DESIGN.1 Option A approved 2026-05-02): LL.5 mechanism name updated
        from "Retrieval ranking learning" → "Dasha-Transit axis-weight modulator"
        in three places (§LL-Appendix.A activation matrix LL.5 row;
        §LL-Appendix.B LL.5 per-mechanism heading; §LL-Appendix narrative inline
        mention). Surgical naming-only edit per brief; no semantic protocol
        changes. v2.1 changelog entry recorded.
    (3) `00_ARCHITECTURE/PHASE_M4C_PLAN_v1_0.md` v1.0 → v1.0.1 — DECISION-1
        propagation (frontmatter `governs:` field; §1.1 LL.5 mechanism heading;
        §3.1 S1 scope heading). Status remains DRAFT. v1.0.1 §7 changelog entry.
    (4) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL_v1_0.md` v1.0 → v1.0.1 —
        DECISION-1 propagation (§1 narrative mention; §2 per-mechanism shadow-
        register table LL.5 row). Status remains APPROVED (NAP.M4.4 verdict scope
        unaffected — naming surface only). v1.0.1 §9 changelog entry.
    (5) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.json` v2.2 → v2.3 — registered TWO
        new entries (M4_B_CLOSE_v1_0 closing F.RT.S6.M.2 LOW carry-forward;
        M4_C_CLOSE_v1_0 NEW for this session); bumped one existing entry
        (SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL_v1_0 version 1.0 → 1.0.1 per DECISION-1 propagation).
        entry_count 135 → 137; manifest_fingerprint extended with
        `+m4c_s4_close_2026-05-02`; last_updated 2026-05-02; last_updated_by
        M4-C-S4-CLOSE. Python json.load() parse-clean (verified). MACRO_PLAN
        + PHASE_M4C_PLAN are NOT in the manifest at all (governance docs in
        00_ARCHITECTURE/) — version bumps recorded in their own changelogs but
        not in manifest entries.
    (6) `.geminirules` — appended M4-C-S4 footer entry capturing cumulative
        S2+S3+P6+P7+S4 delta + LL.5/LL.6/LL.7 status + DECISION-1+DECISION-2

        F.M4CS3.MIRROR.1 + F.M4CP7.MIRROR.1 LOW DISCHARGED at this S4 mirror sync.
    (7) `.gemini/project_state.md` — banner narrative line-3 rewritten with M4-C-S4
        narrative (prior M4-C-S1 narrative preserved as `_Prior session narrative
        retained_`); §"Active Phase" header section rewritten with M4-C SUB-PHASE
        CLOSED + M4-D INCOMING block + LL.1–LL.7 status + carry-forwards roster.
    (8) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md` v3.1 → v3.2 (this update). Canonical
        state pointers ROTATED per AC.S4.7: `last_session_id` → M4-C-S4-CLOSE;
        `next_session_objective` rewritten → M4-D-S1 (M4 macro-phase close per
        PHASE_M4D_PLAN_v1_0.md authored at P7); `active_phase_plan_sub_phase`

        0 → 1 (S4 substantive close-class) → 0 (IS.8(b)-class sub-phase-close

        `cross_check_hash` updated; `predraft_available` block PRESERVED
        (PHASE_M4D_PLAN_v1_0.md still pending consumption at M4-D-S1; M4_C_CLOSE

        from the predraft-availability block since the consumption happened);
        `parallel_session_notes` block rewritten to NONE (S4 single-track close-

    §7.2 of M4_C_CLOSE_v1_0.md per PHASE_M4C_PLAN §3.4 AC.M4C.S4.3. 5 axes:
    (a) LL.5/LL.6/LL.7 held-out partition spot-check across all 3 shadow files
    — 37 training + 9 held_out_excluded verified PASS; (b) DECISION-1 + DECISION-2
    audit trail — traceable across NAP_M4_6_BRIEF v1.2 + ll7_discovery_prior_v1_0.json
    outer metadata + SESSION_LOG M4-C-S3 entry + M4_C_CLOSE_v1_0.md PASS;

    propagation (AC.S4.3) — old name "Retrieval ranking learning" present only
    in changelog audit-trail entries (3 instances: MACRO_PLAN line 35; PHASE_M4C_PLAN
    line 540; SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL line 282); substantive references all updated
    PASS; (e) Mirror sync (AC.S4.1) — `.geminirules` reflects M4-C-S4 footer +
    `.gemini/project_state.md` reflects M4-C SUB-PHASE CLOSED banner + §Active
    Phase header rewrite PASS. Verdict: **PASS** 5/5 axes; 0 CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/
    LOW/NOTE/INFO new findings. Counter rotation: 0 → 1 (S4 substantive close-class)
    → 0 (IS.8(b)-class sub-phase-close cadence discharge per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES
    §G; same convention as M4-B-S6-CLOSE). Next IS.8(a) every-third cadence-fires
    at counter=3 (three substantive sessions hence — likely after first three
    M4-D sessions). Next IS.8(b) macro-phase-close cadence at M4-D close per
    PHASE_M4_PLAN §3.4 AC.M4D.4. Next §IS.8(c) every-12-months MACRO_PLAN review
    remains 2027-04-23 due.
    Substantive findings to flag forward (carry-forwards):
      - **CF.LL7.1** (carries from S3) — CDLM Pancha-MP anchor patch deferred
        M4-D/M5; required by L2.5 CDLM authoring session.
      - **R.LL1TPA.1** (carries — NOT_REACHABLE persists at S4) — Gemini
        reachability final M4 re-attempt obligation at M4-D entry per
        LL1_TWO_PASS_APPROVAL §5.5.
      - **R.LL5DESIGN.1** + **R.LL6DESIGN.1** CLOSED at this S4 via DECISION-1
        propagation.
      - **F.M4CS3.MIRROR.1** + **F.M4CP7.MIRROR.1** + **F.RT.S6.M.1** CLOSED at
        this S4 via mirror sync execution (AC.S4.1 FIRST act).
      - **F.RT.S6.M.2** CLOSED at this S4 via M4_B_CLOSE manifest registration
        (AC.S4.6).
      - **R.LL6FINDING.1** (carries informational) — H2 rejected; informational
        input to M4-D's hypothesis ranking on LL.4 §2.2.
      - **F.RT.S6.N.1** (still carries) — parallel-session version-coordination
        protocol formalization at next quarterly governance pass 2026-07-24.
      - **F.RT.S6.I.1** (carries) — outer-metadata stale-doc-hint at next
        LL.1 production-register touch (M4-D / M5).
      - **R.LL3.1/.2/.3** (carries, deferred-to-M4D-pipeline-change).
      - **R.LL5DESIGN.2** (carries informational) — lit_source=both 0.5/0.5
        fixed-point convention; revisit at M5 cohort-mode.
      - Per-edge LL.2 promotion (carries) — M4-D scope.
      - KR.M4A.RT.LOW.1 + KR.M4A.CLOSE.2 + GAP.M4A.04 partial-close (carries).
    parallel_session_notes: This S4 ran as a single-track sub-phase close-class
    session (no parallel slots open at S4 entry). The M4-C-P6-S4-PREDRAFT
    (M4_C_CLOSE pre-draft, 2026-05-03) and M4-C-P7-M4D-ENTRY-PREP (PHASE_M4D_PLAN
    + NAP_M4_7_BRIEF, 2026-05-02 v3.1) governance asides preceded this S4 close
    chronologically; both pre-drafts pending consumption at the time of S4 entry.
    M4_C_CLOSE pre-draft CONSUMED + sealed at this S4 close. PHASE_M4D_PLAN +
    NAP_M4_7_BRIEF remain pending consumption at M4-D-S1 (M4 macro-phase close
    future session). drift_detector.py / schema_validator.py / mirror_enforcer.py
    re-run at this S4 close to confirm no cross-check regression (AC.S4.9 baseline
    target 108 violations).
  - v3.1 (2026-05-02, M4-C-P7-M4D-ENTRY-PREP): Parallel governance slot —
    forward-pointer plan + decision-pending NAP brief authored ahead of
    M4-D macro-phase close. Same convention as M4-B-P5-M4C-ENTRY-PREP
    (which authored PHASE_M4C_PLAN ahead of M4-C-S1) and M4-C-P6-S4-PREDRAFT
    (which authored M4_C_CLOSE pre-draft ahead of M4-C-S4). Per
    ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G this class does not increment the red-team
    counter. Canonical state pointers UNCHANGED per AC.P7.4 hard_constraint
    (S4 owns canonical pointer rotation when M4-C sealing happens).
    version_collision_note: Brief AC.P7.4 prescribed "CURRENT_STATE → v3.2
    (S4 takes v3.1; check before writing)". At my read time the live file
    was at v3.0 (set by M4-C-S3-LL7-DISCOVERY-PRIOR 2026-05-02) — S4 has not
    yet landed (last commit is 78ae785 chore-stamp for S3). Per the brief
    operational rule "take whatever is current+1" this P7 session adapts to
    v3.1 rather than v3.2. When M4-C-S4 sub-phase close lands, it will read
    live state and adapt to v3.2 (or higher) per the same rule. Sequence so
    far: v3.0 (S3) → v3.1 (this P7); v3.2 reserved for S4. v2.1 remains the
    only permanently vacant gap in the post-rebuild sequence.
    Substantive deliverables (within may_touch only):
    (1) `00_ARCHITECTURE/PHASE_M4D_PLAN_v1_0.md` v1.0 NEW DRAFT — M4-D
        execution plan authored ahead of M4-D-S1 (the M4 macro-phase close
        substantive session). Six sections per AC.P7.2: §1 Scope (inputs from
        M4-A/B/C close documents; outputs M4_CLOSE + REDTEAM_M4 + HANDOFF +
        CURRENT_STATE flip); §2 Entry gates (M4-C formally CLOSED;
        NAP.M4.7 brief authored + presented; IS.8(b) macro-phase-close
        red-team required at M4-D-S1; all open carry-forwards either resolved
        or explicitly accepted); §3 Sub-phase plan (single substantive close
        session M4-D-S1 with 10 work items (a)–(j) per AC.P7.2); §4 M5
        inputs from M4 (8 categories: 30 LL.1 production weights; 9,922 LL.2
        shadow edges gate-unblocked; LL.5 dasha_weight 380 signals; LL.6
        density_weight 37 events × 380 signals; LL.7 107 novel + 136
        unconfirmed + 8 sanity-anchors all novel; LL.4 qualitative priors;
        CF.LL7.1 CDLM-patch workstream; LEL v1.6 with 46 events / 37 train /
        9 held-out sacrosanct); §5 Known residuals entering M4-D —
        exhaustive 41-item roster classified resolve-in-M4-D (R) /
        accept-as-M5-input (A) / defer-post-M5 (D) / closed-prior-to-M4-D
        (C); §6 Changelog. Status DRAFT — flips CURRENT at M4-D-S1 open
        or amended-in-place per actual M4-C exit conditions documented at
        M4-C-S4 sub-phase close.
    (2) `00_ARCHITECTURE/EVAL/NAP_M4_7_BRIEF_v1_0.md` v1.0 NEW
        PENDING_NATIVE_DECISION — M4 macro-phase close approval brief.
        Six sections per AC.P7.3: §1 What NAP.M4.7 decides (binding gate
        on CURRENT_STATE M4 → M5 flip; native judgment is final arbiter;
        brief presents picture without pre-deciding); §2 M4 summary for
        native review (W1 + A + B + C deliverables; key numbers — 46 LEL
        events / 30 production LL.1 signals / 5 LL mechanisms / 107 novel
        LL.7 discoveries / 243 LL.7 emitted pairs / 8 sanity anchors all
        novel; explicit list of "what did NOT happen" — DBN; surface
        wiring; held-out test prospective form; external acharya review;
        JH D9 export; MSR ID gap; CDLM patch); §3 Four conditions for
        approval ((a) 30 LL.1 production weights trustworthy for M5;
        (b) 107 LL.7 novel discoveries sufficiently interesting; (c)
        CF.LL7.1 CDLM-patch disposition Option α/β/γ; (d) no open
        issue blocks M5 entry); §4 Decision template (APPROVED / HELD /
        REJECTED — symmetric framing; per-condition sub-fields; default
        per PHASE_M4_PLAN §5); §5 Downstream consequences per outcome
        path (APPROVED → CURRENT_STATE flip + HANDOFF sealed + first M5
        priorities; HELD → M4-D-S1 PARTIAL close + remediation session;
        REJECTED → brief re-opens v1.1); §6 Changelog with brief-neutrality
        statement honoring AC.P7.3 hard_constraint.
    (3) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md` v3.0 → v3.1 (this update).
        Canonical state pointers UNCHANGED per AC.P7.4 hard_constraint:
        `last_session_id: M4-C-S3-LL7-DISCOVERY-PRIOR` preserved (S4 owns
        rotation); `next_session_objective` rewritten in §3 narrative to
        also surface M4-C-P7 alongside the M4-C-S4 next-pointer (S4 still
        owns canonical rotation when it seals); `active_phase_plan_sub_phase`
        preserved (S3 close text); `red_team_counter: 0` preserved;
        `file_updated_at` + `file_updated_by_session` preserved per
        governance-aside parallel-slot convention (precedent:
        M4-B-P5-M4C-ENTRY-PREP held canonical pointers unchanged at v2.5
        and M4-C-P6-S4-PREDRAFT held canonical pointers unchanged at v2.7).
        `predraft_available` block re-set to PHASE_M4D_PLAN_v1_0.md per
        AC.P7.4 (M4_C_CLOSE_v1_0.md DRAFT pre-draft — authored at
        M4-C-P6-S4-PREDRAFT 2026-05-03 commit 0934efb — preserved as
        inline comment record; consumer remains M4-C-S4 future session).
        New parallel_session_notes block at v3.1 records this P7 governance
        aside coordination (parallel-safe with M4-C-S4 close which will
        consume both pre-drafts).
    (4) `00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_LOG.md` — entry appended (commit hash
        stamped post-commit per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §F chore-commit
        pattern matching prior M4-class governance asides).

    `.geminirules` + `.gemini/project_state.md` (mirror propagation NOT
    executed this session per brief must_not_touch — F.M4CP7.MIRROR.1
    LOW carries to next mirror-touch likely M4-C-S4 sub-phase close);
    `platform/**`. Scope honored.
    Red-team: NOT FIRED in-session — governance-aside class per
    ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G does not increment counter; counter
    unchanged at 0 (set by M4-C-S3-LL7-DISCOVERY-PRIOR IS.8(a) cadence-fire
    discharge). Next IS.8(a) every-third cadence-fires at counter=3 (three
    substantive sessions hence — likely after M4-C-S4 + M4-D-S1 + first
    M5 session). Next IS.8(b) macro-phase-close at M4-D-S1 per
    PHASE_M4_PLAN §3.4 AC.M4D.2.
    Substantive findings to flag forward (carry-forwards):
      - **F.M4CP7.MIRROR.1** (NEW) LOW — mirror MP.1+MP.2 NOT propagated
        this session (`.geminirules` + `.gemini/project_state.md` excluded
        per brief must_not_touch). v3.1 forward-pointer plan + NAP brief
        delta carries to next mirror-touch session, likely M4-C-S4
        sub-phase close.
      - **NAP.M4.7** (NEW PENDING_NATIVE_DECISION) — M4 macro-phase close
        approval brief authored at this session; consumed at M4-D-S1 per
        PHASE_M4D_PLAN §3.1 work item (h). Native verdict gates the
        M4 → M5 CURRENT_STATE flip at work item (j).
      - All carry-forwards from v3.0 (CF.LL7.1; F.M4CS3.MIRROR.1;
        R.LL5DESIGN.1; R.LL6DESIGN.1; R.LL6FINDING.1; R.LL1TPA.1;
        R.LL3.1/.2/.3; F.RT.S6.M.2; F.RT.S6.N.1; F.RT.S6.I.1) preserved
        unchanged.
    parallel_session_notes: This P7 ran as a parallel governance slot
    alongside M4-C-S4 (M4-C sub-phase close — not yet landed at this
    session's open). Same convention as M4-B-P5-M4C-ENTRY-PREP (parallel
    to M4-B-S6) and M4-C-P6-S4-PREDRAFT (parallel to M4-C-S3). Conflict
    surfaces: CURRENT_STATE.md (this session sets v3.1 with canonical
    pointers UNCHANGED; S4 will read live state and adapt to v3.2+ per
    the operational rule "current+1"); SESSION_LOG.md (this session
    appends its own entry; S4's entry is independent). drift_detector.py
    / schema_validator.py / mirror_enforcer.py to be re-run at M4-C-S4
    close to confirm no cross-check regression.
  - v3.0 (2026-05-02, M4-C-S3-LL7-DISCOVERY-PRIOR): Substantive learning-layer-
    substrate session — third M4-C session; LL.7 (Discovery Prior Rubric, native-only
    mode) first SHADOW write under NAP.M4.6 OPTION_B_APPROVED + DECISION-2 literal
    msr_anchors-clique CDLM construction (both decisions 2026-05-02). Sequential
    after M4-C-S1+S2 parallel-pair landed (v2.8/v2.9); not parallel-safe with any
    open M4-C session — S3 was a single-track session with the IS.8(a) red-team
    cadence firing at counter=3.
    Substantive deliverables (within may_touch only):
    (1) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/LL7_DISCOVERY_PRIOR_DESIGN_v1_0.md`
        v1.0 NEW — design doc authored before computation per AC.S3.2. Eight
        sections: §1 mechanism (Option B classical-seeded with three NAP refinements;
        DECISION-2 literal msr_anchors-clique CDLM construction; four-class
        confirmed/unconfirmed/novel/contradicted taxonomy with noise excluded;
        gate = raw N≥3 per NAP §6.3(b) verbatim with density-weighted reported
        alongside as informational per LL.6 design's H2-rejected stance —
        in-session calibration note: a purely density-weighted gate at N≥3.0
        was found to drop pair MSR.118↔MSR.145 to weighted=2.9485 / raw=5,
        which would have failed the 8-anchor sanity-check by design; raw-gate
        is the principled choice and aligns with LL.6 design intent); §2 input
        spec (7 sources: CDLM, LEL, LL.1, LL.2, LL.6, LL.3, SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL);
        §3 algorithm (5 steps — build CDLM edge set, compute pair co-activations
        both raw + density-weighted, classify on raw, emit, sanity-check); §4
        sanity-check REVISED — 8 MED-tier LL.2 anchors classify as `novel`
        (not `confirmed`) under literal construction; sanity_anchor_novel_count==8
        is the gate; NAP §6.2 anticipatory-rationale clarification recorded;
        CF.LL7.1 CDLM-patch carry-forward flagged for M4-D/M5; §5 shadow-mode
        constraints (no shadow→prod split for native-only mode); §6 output
        schema; §7 known limitations (8 items: CDLM sparsity, Pancha-MP gap,
        density informational not gate, no cross-domain Δ, n=1 risk, contradicted
        empty, held-out discipline, empirical-vs-NAP shape divergence at first
        write — NAP §6.4 expected ~5–15 novels but actual 107); §8 changelog.
    (2) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/signal_weights/shadow/ll7_discovery_prior_v1_0.json`
        NEW — LL.7 shadow register. Outer metadata per design §6 schema

        from 9974 raw co-firing pairs). Summary: `sanity_anchor_novel_count: 8`
        PASS (gate); `sanity_anchor_confirmed_count: 0`;
        `ll2_med_anchor_pairs_present: 8 / 8`. All 8 MED-tier anchors carry
        `cdlm_declared: false` and `support: novel` (sanity verified via
        re-read). Anchor pair empirical evidence (raw / density-weighted):
        MSR.117↔.119 4/3.50; MSR.117↔.402 4/3.50; MSR.118↔.145 5/2.95;

        json.load() parse-clean (verified at write).
    (3) `00_ARCHITECTURE/EVAL/NAP_M4_6_BRIEF_v1_0.md` v1.1 → v1.2 (file path
        remains `_v1_0.md`; in-file version bumped to 1.2; status flipped
        OPTION_B_APPROVED → OPTION_B_APPROVED_LITERAL_CONSTRUCTION). New §6.3.A
        literal-construction correction added (8 MED-tier LL.2 anchors classify
        as `novel` under literal construction; §6.2 native-rationale anticipatory
        not descriptive; CF.LL7.1 CDLM-patch carry-forward flagged; threshold
        mechanics raw-N≥3 clarified). v1.2 changelog entry added.
    (4) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.json` v2.1 → v2.2 — registered TWO
        canonical entries: LL7_DISCOVERY_PRIOR_DESIGN_v1_0 + ll7_discovery_prior_v1_0.

        Python json.load() parse-clean (verified).
    (5) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md` v2.9 → v3.0 (this update). Canonical
        state pointers ROTATED per AC.S3.7: `last_session_id` → M4-C-S3-LL7-
        DISCOVERY-PRIOR; `next_session_objective` rewritten → M4-C-S4 (sub-phase
        close); `red_team_counter` 2 → 3 (substantive increment) → 0 (IS.8(a)
        cadence DISCHARGED in-session at counter=3 per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G);
        `active_phase_plan_sub_phase` extended with S3-done block;
        `file_updated_at` rotated to 2026-05-02 timestamp; `file_updated_by_session`
        → M4-C-S3-LL7-DISCOVERY-PRIOR; `parallel_session_notes` collapsed
        (S3 is single-track; the M4-C-S1+S2 parallel-pair coordination block
        is no longer transient and is removed per §3.6 transient-block convention).
    (6) `00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_LOG.md` — entry appended (commit hash stamped
        post-commit per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §F chore-commit pattern matching
        prior M4-C closes).

    Red-team: IS.8(a) FIRED in-session at counter=3 per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G
    (counter trail: 2→3 substantive M4-C-S3 increment → §IS.8(a) cadence-fire →
    in-session 4-axis red-team conducted per AC.S3.8 → counter resets 3→0).
    Four-axis scope per AC.S3.8: (a) LL.5 shadow-file integrity — verified
    dasha_dominant 259 + transit_dominant 1 + balanced 6 + zero_tier 114 = 380

    none new. Counter resets 3→0 per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G cadence-reset
    clause. Next IS.8(a) every-third cadence-fires at counter=3 (three substantive
    sessions hence — likely after M4-C-S4 + M4-D-S1 + M4-D-S2). Next IS.8(b)

    Next §IS.8(c) every-12-months MACRO_PLAN review remains 2027-04-23 due.
    Substantive findings to flag forward (carry-forwards):
      - **CF.LL7.1** (NEW) — CDLM Pancha-MP anchor patch: add MSR.117/.118/.119/
        .143/.145 to msr_anchors of governing CDLM cells (D1.D1 Sasha-Saturn-Kendra;
        D5.D5 Venus-Malavya; D5.D6 Mars-Ruchaka; D5.D7 Jupiter-Hamsa — illustrative;
        exact cell selection requires L2.5 CDLM authoring session). Until patched,
        the 8 MED-tier LL.2 anchors remain in LL.7 `novel` class — correct under
        current CDLM, not a defect. Owner: M4-D or M5.
      - **F.M4CS3.MIRROR.1** (NEW) LOW — mirror MP.1+MP.2 NOT propagated this
        session (`.geminirules` + `.gemini/project_state.md` excluded per brief
        must_not_touch). LL.7-class delta carries to next mirror-touch session,
        likely M4-C-S4 sub-phase close.
      - **R.LL5DESIGN.1** (carries) — LL.5 mechanism-name propagation to MACRO_PLAN
        / PHASE_M4C_PLAN / SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL deferred to S4 per DECISION-1.
      - **R.LL6DESIGN.1** (carries) — LL.6 mechanism-naming divergence; jointly
        tracked with R.LL5DESIGN.1.
      - **R.LL6FINDING.1** (carries) — LL.6 H2 dense-cluster-inflation rejected
        at n=37; informational input to M4-D's hypothesis ranking on LL.4 §2.2.
        LL.7 inherits the H2-rejected stance by gating on raw N (not weighted).
      - **R.LL1TPA.1** (carries) — Gemini reachability NOT_REACHABLE; surrogate
        flag persists on any pass_1/pass_2 binding invoked downstream. NOT
        re-attempted this session (S3 brief did not require it; mirror propagation
        also out-of-scope per must_not_touch).
      - **R.LL3.1/.2/.3** (carry) — LL.3 fix-before-prod recommendations.
      - **F.RT.S6.M.2** (carries) — M4_B_CLOSE manifest entry not yet registered;
        defer to next manifest touch (not this session — S3 only added LL.7 entries).
      - **F.RT.S6.N.1** (carries) — parallel-session version-coordination convention
        formalization at next quarterly governance pass (2026-07-24 due).
      - **F.RT.S6.I.1** (carries) — outer-metadata stale-doc-hint at next LL.1
        production-register touch.
      - **NAP.M4.7** (carries) — M4 macro-phase close approval gate at M4-D close.
    parallel_session_notes: NONE this session — S3 ran single-track. The prior
    M4-C-S1+S2 parallel-pair coordination block in v2.9 has been collapsed at this
    v3.0 close per the transient-block-removal convention (the parallel-pair race
    has fully settled; both v2.8 and v2.9 entries remain audit-trailed in this
    changelog list).
  - v2.9 (2026-05-02, M4-C-S2-LL6-TEMPORAL-DENSITY): Substantive learning-layer-substrate
    session — second M4-C session, parallel-safe with M4-C-S1 (per PHASE_M4C_PLAN §4
    LL.5 ⊥ LL.6 parallel-safe ruling). LL.6 (Temporal Density Modulator) first shadow
    write. The brief's LL.6 instantiation is "Temporal Density Modulator" — a per-event
    density_weight applied to LL.1 lit_score contributions, not the PHASE_M4C_PLAN §LL.6
    "Plan selection learning" framing; mechanism-naming divergence is the analogue of
    R.LL5DESIGN.1 (logged in S1's v2.8 entry) and is recorded in
    LL6_TEMPORAL_DENSITY_DESIGN_v1_0.md as a self-contained brief-binding scope decision
    per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §C. No new R-finding opened — both M4-C-S1 and M4-C-S2
    naming divergences are tracked under R.LL5DESIGN.1 collectively until next M4-C
    governance pass.
    version_collision_note: Brief AC.S2.5 prescribed "CURRENT_STATE → v2.8 (S1 takes
    v2.7; check before writing)". At my read time the file was already at v2.7
    (M4-C-P6-S4-PREDRAFT 2026-05-03 governance-aside) THEN v2.8 (M4-C-S1-LL5-DASHA-TRANSIT
    landed first). The brief author wrote AC.S2.5 expecting only S1 as a possible
    parallel; in fact P6-S4-PREDRAFT also took a slot between brief authoring and this
    session execution, pushing S1 to v2.8. Per the brief hard_constraint operational
    rule "take whatever is current+1" this S2 session adapts to v2.9. Sequence so far:
    v2.0 → v2.2 → v2.3 → v2.4 → v2.5 → v2.6 → v2.7 → v2.8 → v2.9, with v2.1 the only
    permanently vacant gap.
    Substantive deliverables (within may_touch only):
    (1) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/LL6_TEMPORAL_DENSITY_DESIGN_v1_0.md`
        v1.0 NEW — design doc authored before computation per AC.S2.2. Eight sections:
        §1 mechanism (per-event density_penalty applied to LL.1 lit_score contributions
        — not a per-signal weight register, not promotion-eligible; informational to
        LL.5/LL.7/M4-D); §2 cluster detection algorithm (rolling 365-day window ±182
        days inclusive of self; cluster_size ≥ 1 always; density_weight = 1/log2(cs+1);
        formula values for cs=1→1.0, cs=2→0.6309, cs=3→0.5, cs=4→0.4307, cs=5→0.3869;
        brief enumeration error at cs=2 (0.585 vs formula 0.6309) documented and
        formula treated as authoritative); §3 impact analysis spec (per-signal
        density_adjusted_mean = mean(lit_score × density_weight) across observations;
        delta = raw − adjusted with positive sign for shrinkage; meaningful_flag at
        delta > 0.1); §4 shadow-mode constraints (binding hard-constraint formula
        application; no LL.1 weight revision; shadow_status; held-out partition
        sacrosanct; no two-pass approval this round); §5 output schema for the JSON;
        §6 LL.4 H2 dense-cluster-inflation test (informational only — finding below);
        §7 known limitations (6 items: window heuristic; formula choice; event-symmetric
        not signal-anchored cluster; held-out not penalized; n=37 floor; no LL.2
        interaction; brief enumeration error at cs=2); §8 changelog.
    (2) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/signal_weights/shadow/ll6_temporal_density_v1_0.json`
        NEW — LL.6 shadow register. Outer metadata per §5 schema (schema_version 1.0;
        mechanism LL.6; phase M4-C; produced_during M4-C-S2-LL6-TEMPORAL-DENSITY;
        rubric_version 1.0 / rubric_option B; training_events_used 37;
        held_out_excluded 9; cluster_window_days 365 / radius 182 / threshold 3;
        density_formula `1 / log2(cluster_size + 1)`; meaningful_delta_threshold 0.1;
        n1_disclaimer verbatim per protocol §7). Cluster-size distribution
        {1: 7, 2: 10, 3: 11, 4: 8, 5: 1}. 37 events array (event_id, event_date_used,
        cluster_size, density_weight). 380 signals array (mean_lit_score_raw,
        mean_lit_score_density_adjusted, delta, meaningful_flag, n_observations).
        Summary: meaningful_adjustment_count 255 of 380 (67% at delta>0.1); mean delta
        0.2202; max delta 0.5693 (signal observed entirely in cluster_size=5 event);
        min delta 0.0 (signal observed only in cluster_size=1 events). H2 dense-
        cluster-inflation test: raw_training_mean 0.6300; density_adjusted_training_mean
        weighted-form 0.6231 (gap_reduction −0.0069 — gap actually grew slightly);
        plain-form 0.3813 (gap_reduction −0.2487 — gap worsened). Both forms argue
        AGAINST dense-cluster inflation as a load-bearing explanation of the
        held_out>training gap; LL.4 §2.2 H1 (decade-stratified selection bias) and
        H2 (LEL retrodictive labeling bias) remain the load-bearing explanations.
        Finding is informational only — no LL.1 weight revision triggered per shadow-
        mode discipline. Python json.load() parse-clean (verified at write time).
    (3) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.json` v2.0 → v2.1 — registered FOUR
        canonical entries per AC.S2.4 (S1 brief explicitly deferred manifest-touch to
        S2): LL5_DASHA_TRANSIT_DESIGN_v1_0 (S1 design doc); ll5_dasha_transit_v1_0
        (S1 shadow JSON); LL6_TEMPORAL_DENSITY_DESIGN_v1_0 (S2 design doc);
        ll6_temporal_density_v1_0 (S2 shadow JSON). entry_count 129 → 133;
        manifest_fingerprint extended with `+m4c_s2_ll6_2026-05-02`; last_updated
        2026-05-02; last_updated_by M4-C-S2-LL6-TEMPORAL-DENSITY. Python json.load()
        parse-clean (verified).
    (4) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md` v2.8 → v2.9 (this update). Canonical
        state pointers ROTATED per AC.S2.5: `last_session_id` → M4-C-S2-LL6-TEMPORAL-
        DENSITY (overrides S1 value M4-C-S1-LL5-DASHA-TRANSIT — this is the

    R.LL6DESIGN.1 (mechanism-naming divergence: brief assigns LL.6 = Temporal

    §2 assign LL.6 = Plan selection learning at path PLAN_SELECTION/. Brief is
    binding for this session per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §C; divergence flagged for
    next M4-C governance pass / native review jointly with R.LL5DESIGN.1).
    R.LL6FINDING.1 (LL.6 H2 dense-cluster-inflation test rejected at n=37; finding
    informational; M4-D may use as input to ranking the LL.4 §2.2 H1+H2 hypothesis
    priorities). R.LL1TPA.1 carries (Gemini reachability NOT_REACHABLE per S1 v2.8

    downstream).
    parallel_session_notes (S1+S2 coordination): S1 (M4-C-S1-LL5-DASHA-TRANSIT) and
    S2 (M4-C-S2-LL6-TEMPORAL-DENSITY) ran as parallel-safe substantive learning-
    layer-substrate sessions per PHASE_M4C_PLAN §4 LL.5 ⊥ LL.6 ruling. Disjoint
    file scopes by may_touch declaration: S1 owns LL5_*+ll5_*+`.geminirules`+
    `.gemini/project_state.md`; S2 owns LL6_*+ll6_*+CAPABILITY_MANIFEST. Conflict
    surface: CURRENT_STATE.md + SESSION_LOG.md (both touched by both sessions).
    Race outcome at this commit: S1 landed first (v2.8); this S2 reads live state +
    takes v2.9 + updates canonical pointers to chronologically-later last-writer-wins
    semantics. S1's deliverables fully audit-trailed in v2.8 changelog block;
    S1's manifest deferral (S1 must_not_touch CAPABILITY_MANIFEST per S1 brief
    AC.S1.6) discharged here at AC.S2.4 — both LL.5 and LL.6 pairs registered in
    one manifest pass v2.0 → v2.1. red_team_counter merged value 2 reflects both
    substantive sessions' increments (S1 0→1; S2 1→2) per the increment-each-session
    convention. Mirror MP.1+MP.2 sync was discharged at S1 v2.8 close per S1 brief;

    version_collision_note: Brief AC.S1.5 prescribed "CURRENT_STATE → v2.7 (S2 parallel
    takes v2.8; check before writing)". At my read time the file was at v2.7 (set by
    parallel governance-aside M4-C-P6-S4-PREDRAFT 2026-05-03; v2.7 changelog block
    explicitly notes "If S3 lands at v2.7 chronologically before this commit,
    version-conflict arises — S3 should re-read the live file and take v2.8"). The
    same operational rule applies here: take whatever is current+1. v2.7 is occupied
    (P6 forward-pointer pre-draft of M4_C_CLOSE_v1_0.md), not vacant; this S1 session
    adapts to v2.8 per the same explicit operational rule. The brief author wrote AC.S1.5
    expecting only S2 as a possible parallel; in fact P6 took v2.7 between the brief
    authoring and this session execution. Sequence so far: v2.0 → v2.2 → v2.3 → v2.4 →
    v2.5 → v2.6 → v2.7 → v2.8, with v2.1 the only permanently vacant gap. M4-C-S2 (if
    parallel) takes v2.9 or higher per the same rule.
    Substantive deliverables (within may_touch only):
    (1) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/LL5_DASHA_TRANSIT_DESIGN_v1_0.md`
        v1.0 NEW — design doc frozen BEFORE the LL.5 computation runs (per AC.S1.3
        hard constraint). Seven sections: §1 mechanism definition (per-signal axis-
        weight modulator in [0,1]; `dasha_weight = (dasha_count + 0.5*both_count) /
        total_activations`); §2 input spec (lel_event_match_records.json training
        partition; ll1_shadow_weights.signal_weights as canonical 380-signal roster;
        LL.4 §3 informational); §3 algorithm (11-step deterministic pass; tier rules
        N≥8 HIGH, 4-7 MED, 1-3 LOW, 0 ZERO; both-count split 0.5/0.5 fixed-point);
        §4 shadow-mode constraints (path discipline; two-pass approval cadence;
        n=1 disclaimer; held-out partition explicit filter; promotion blocked); §5
        output schema; §6 known limitations (6 items: skewed lit_source distribution
        at n=37; rubric-fidelity dependency; both-split approximation logged as
        R.LL5DESIGN.2; 252 LOW-tier signals unstable; mechanism-naming divergence
        logged as R.LL5DESIGN.1; single-pass design without dedicated stability gate);
        §7 changelog.
    (2) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/signal_weights/shadow/ll5_dasha_transit_v1_0.json`
        NEW — LL.5 axis-weight register, shadow-mode. Outer metadata per §5 schema
        (schema_version 1.0; mechanism LL.5; phase M4-C; produced_during M4-C-S1-
        LL5-DASHA-TRANSIT; produced_on 2026-05-02; design_doc_version 1.0;

        ll1_shadow_weights as signal_roster]; training_events_used 37;
        held_out_excluded 9; promotion_criteria_ref SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §3.5;
        n1_disclaimer verbatim per protocol §7 + LL.5 lit_source-skew note;
        variance_estimator: "sample"). Summary block: total_signals 380 / high 2 /
        med 12 / low 252 / zero 114 / dasha_dominant 259 / transit_dominant 1 /
        balanced 6. signals[] one row per signal_id sorted ascending; 380 rows total.
        Python json.load() parse-clean (verified at write time per AC.S1.7).
        Empirical finding (documented in LL5_DASHA_TRANSIT_DESIGN §6.1): training-
        partition lit_source distribution = dasha 410 / transit 4 / both 6 across
        420 actual_lit activations (rubric_option B prioritizes dasha-window
        attribution); the only non-dasha-dominant signals are SIG.13 (4 transit /
        0 dasha → dasha_weight 0.0) and 6 signals firing only via "both" lit_source
        (dasha_weight 0.5). Production weight not written (must_not_touch
        signal_weights/production/** + LL.5 promotion criteria still TBD in
        SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §3.5).
    (3) `.geminirules` — footer entry appended at top of M4-related footer block:
        "*M4-C-S1 MIRROR SYNC (2026-05-02): MP.1 + MP.2 mirror sync ...*" — adapted-

        complete (production state); LL.5–LL.7 incoming. Discharges F.RT.S6.M.1.
    (4) `.gemini/project_state.md` — line-3 update banner prepended with new
        narrative paragraph for M4-C-S1; prior M4-B-P3 narrative wrapped as
        "_Prior session narrative retained: M4-B-P3-MIRROR-MANIFEST (...)._".

        block + open NAPs + M3 closure preservation. Discharges F.RT.S6.M.1.
    (5) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md` v2.7 → v2.8 (this update).
        Canonical state pointers ROTATED per AC.S1.5: `last_session_id` → M4-C-S1-
        LL5-DASHA-TRANSIT; `active_phase_plan_sub_phase` rewritten with M4-C ACTIVE
        block (S1 done; S2 next; S3/S4 forward); `next_session_objective` → M4-C-S2
        (LL.6 first shadow write per PHASE_M4C_PLAN §3.2; LL.5 ⊥ LL.6 parallel-safe);
        `red_team_counter` 0 → 1 (S1 substantive; IS.8(a) cadence-fires at counter=3);
        `file_updated_at` rotated to 2026-05-02; `file_updated_by_session` rotated to
        M4-C-S1-LL5-DASHA-TRANSIT. The predraft_* block (set by P6 at v2.7) is
        PRESERVED; M4_C_CLOSE_v1_0.md DRAFT remains the M4-C-S4 close consumer
        artifact; P6's metadata is unrelated to this S1 session.

    §2 assign LL.5 = Retrieval ranking learning at path RANKER_WEIGHTS/. Brief is
    binding for this session per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §C; divergence flagged for
    next M4-C governance pass / native review — possible resolutions: rename this
    artifact's mechanism, renumber retrieval ranking, or reassign Dasha-Transit
    Synergy outside the LL.5/LL.6/LL.7 sequence). R.LL5DESIGN.2 (both-count split
    0.5/0.5 fixed-point rule; resolves at next LL.5 cycle when rubric emits per-axis
    sub-scores OR when corpus grows to n≥100). R.LL1TPA.1 carries (Gemini reachability
    re-attempted at this session — NOT_REACHABLE persists; surrogate flag continues
    on any pass_1/pass_2 binding invoked downstream).
  - v2.7 (2026-05-03, M4-C-P6-S4-PREDRAFT): Parallel-slot governance-aside session.
    Authored as a forward-pointer pre-draft slot alongside (and not after) M4-C-S3
    (LL.7 first artifact write per NAP.M4.6 Option B). At my read time the file was
    at v2.6 (set by M4-B-S6-CLOSE 2026-05-03 commit 007c718); v2.7 is the next slot
    per the brief hard_constraint operational rule "check the live file before
    writing; take whatever is current + 1." S3 has not yet landed at the moment of
    this close (no M4-C-S* commits in git log; latest M4-related commits are
    af82d8e NAP.M4.6 verdict + ecd30a2 chore stamp + 4948a48 W2-UQE smoke); when
    S3 lands it takes v2.8 (or higher) per the same current+1 convention.
    parallel_session_notes: This session does NOT alter canonical state pointers
    (`last_session_id`, `next_session_objective`, `active_phase_plan_sub_phase`,
    `red_team_counter`, `file_updated_at`, `file_updated_by_session` all remain as
    set by predecessor M4-B-S6-CLOSE at v2.6). The brief AC.P6.3 hard_constraint
    explicitly stated "session_notes: parallel governance slot; CURRENT_STATE
    canonical pointers (last_session_id, next_session_objective) must not be
    overwritten — S3 owns them" — that constraint is honored. Single deliverable
    (within may_touch only): a pre-draft of the M4-C sub-phase sealing artifact,
    authored as a structural skeleton with all S1/S2/S3/S4-dependent fields held
    as literal `[PENDING-S*]` tokens per the brief hard_constraint "Do not
    pre-decide S3 outcomes (novel edge count, sanity-check result). Every
    S3-dependent field is [PENDING-S3]." Brief also instructed to read S1+S2
    SESSION_LOG entries if those sub-phases had closed by the time this session
    ran and fill §2 + §5 rows from actual outcomes; check at write time confirmed
    neither S1 nor S2 had closed yet — all S1/S2/S3/S4-dependent fields therefore
    remain [PENDING-S*]; S4 reads actual outcomes at close.

    red_team_counter unchanged at 0 (set by M4-B-S6-CLOSE 1→0 IS.8(b) discharge).
    Mirror MP.1/MP.2 not propagated (governance-aside; carry-forward to first
    substantive M4-C close that touches .geminirules / .gemini/project_state.md
    per existing convention; F.RT.S6.M.1 MEDIUM finding from M4-B-S6 still binds
    M4-C-S1 entry).
    parallel_session_notes (S3 coordination): At write time S3 has not yet landed.
    If S3 lands at v2.7 chronologically before this commit, version-conflict
    arises — S3 should re-read the live file and take v2.8. This session's
    AC.P6.3 hard_constraint is "current+1; check before writing"; same rule
    applies to S3. last_session_id race: this session does NOT touch
    last_session_id (canonical pointer UNCHANGED per AC.P6.3); S3 will write
    its own last_session_id at S3 close. At merge time, S3's last_session_id
    wins (it's a substantive close, this is governance-aside); this v2.7
    changelog block sits below S3's. drift_detector.py / schema_validator.py /
    mirror_enforcer.py to be re-run after merge.
  - v2.6 (2026-05-03, M4-B-S6-CLOSE, commit 007c718): **M4-B SUB-PHASE CLOSED.** Substantive close-class
    session. The M4-B sealing artifact `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/
    M4_B_CLOSE_v1_0.md` was sealed at this session — frontmatter `status: DRAFT` →
    `CLOSED`; new fields `sealed_by: M4-B-S6-CLOSE` + `sealed_at: 2026-05-03` added; all
    `[PENDING-S5]` and `[PENDING-S6]` tokens resolved against the actual S5 outcome
    (NAP.M4.5 30/30 approved; LL.1 production register flag flipped true; per-signal
    `status: production` for all 30 signals; LL2_STABILITY_GATE FULL_PASS;
    LL1_TWO_PASS_APPROVAL TWO_PASS_COMPLETE; LL4_PREDICTION_PRIOR v1.1 +
    `ll4_prediction_priors_v1_0.json` machine-readable view; Gemini NOT_REACHABLE —
    R.LL1TPA.1 carries to M4-C; F.RT.S4.1 closed via `variance_estimator: sample`).
    The IS.8(b)-class M4-B sub-phase-close red-team was conducted **in-document at
    M4_B_CLOSE §7.2** — 5 axes, PASS_WITH_FINDINGS verdict (0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH /
    1 MEDIUM (mirror staleness M4-B-CLOSED checkpoint, F.RT.S6.M.1, carry to M4-C-S1
    sync) / 1 LOW (M4_B_CLOSE manifest entry, F.RT.S6.M.2, carry to next manifest
    touch) / 1 NOTE (parallel-session version-coordination protocol formalization,
    F.RT.S6.N.1, carry to next quarterly governance pass) / 1 INFO (outer-metadata
    stale-doc-hint on ll1_weights_promoted production_status_field_value field,
    F.RT.S6.I.1, carry to next LL.1 production-register touch)).
    version_collision_note: Brief AC.S6.5 prescribed "CURRENT_STATE → v2.5". At my read
    time the file was at v2.5, taken earlier today by parallel-slot session
    M4-B-P5-M4C-ENTRY-PREP (commit e3997cc). P5's own changelog explicitly notes
    "when S6 lands it takes v2.6 (or higher) per the same current+1 convention" —
    this S6 session adapts to v2.6 per that explicit guidance and the same
    operational rule "take whatever version is current + 1." v2.5 is occupied
    (P5's forward-pointer plan + NAP.M4.6 brief authoring), not vacant; the
    sequence v2.0 → v2.2 → v2.3 → v2.4 → v2.5 → v2.6 is the accepted record with
    v2.1 as the only permanently vacant gap.
    Substantive deliverables (within may_touch only):
    (1) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/M4_B_CLOSE_v1_0.md` v1.0 DRAFT
        → v1.0 SEAL — every PENDING token resolved; status flipped DRAFT → CLOSED;
        sealed_by + sealed_at frontmatter fields added; red_team_artifact frontmatter
        field re-authored to cite §7.2 in-document; executive summary rewritten with
        concrete S5 outcome; §1.2 sub-phase rounds table filled for S5/P3/S6;
        §2 AC ledger flipped to 10/10 PASS (AC.M4B.8 pass_2 clause discharged);
        §2.3 (S5 ACs) + §2.4 (S6 ACs) populated with PASS verdicts; §3 deliverables
        inventory updated for S5 amendments + LL.4 priors JSON + this seal; §3.2
        governance-state row updated; §4.2 NAP.M4.5 RESOLVED with full disposition
        ledger; §5.1 LL.1 PRODUCTION (30/30); §5.2 LL.2 FULL_PASS; §5.4 LL.4 v1.1 +
        priors JSON; §6.1 F.RT.S4.1 CLOSED; §6.2 [PENDING-S5] dependents resolved;
        §7.1 cadence trail filled; §7.2 IS.8(b) red-team conducted in-document
        (5 axes; 4 findings classified); §7.3 counter-at-close + cadence forecast;
        §8 approval ledger discharge clean; §9 v1.0 SEAL changelog entry added.
    (2) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.json` v1.9 → **v2.0** — registered
        `ll4_prediction_priors_v1_0` canonical entry (deferred from M4-B-P3 per
        brief). entry_count 128 → 129; manifest_fingerprint extended with
        `+m4b_s6_close_2026-05-03`. Python `json.load()` parse-clean (verified).
        v2.0 marker = clean M4-B-close marker per brief AC.S6.3.
    (3) `00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_LOG.md` — schema_validator violations fixed:
        (a) M4-B-P3-MIRROR-MANIFEST entry: `session_open` YAML block reconstructed
        retroactively (closes 1 CRITICAL `session_log_entry_missing_session_open_yaml`);
        (b) M4-B-P4-S6-PREDRAFT entry heading: `## 2026-05-02 — M4-B-P4-S6-PREDRAFT
        — ...` → `## M4-B-P4-S6-PREDRAFT — ...` (closes 2 HIGH heading-vs-session-id
        disagreement violations on open + close); (c) M4-B-P4-S6-PREDRAFT entry
        body: `### Next session objective` heading added (closes 1 LOW
        `session_log_entry_missing_next_objective_heading`). Net schema_validator:
        112 → 108 (matches M4-B-S3/S4 close 108-baseline; AC.S6.4 target met).
    (4) `00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_LOG.md` — M4-B-S6-CLOSE entry appended (this
        session). Commit hash will be stamped post-commit per
        ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §F chore commit pattern matching prior M4-B closes.
    (5) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md` v2.5 → v2.6 (this update). Canonical
        state pointers rotated per brief AC.S6.5: `last_session_id` → M4-B-S6-CLOSE;
        `active_phase_plan_sub_phase` → M4-B CLOSED 2026-05-03; M4-C incoming;
        `next_session_objective` → M4-C-S1 (LL.5 Dasha-Transit Synergy shadow-mode);
        `red_team_counter` 1 → 0 (IS.8(b) discharged); `predraft_available` field
        cleared (deliverable consumed); `file_updated_at` + `file_updated_by_session`
        rotated. Mirror MP.1/MP.2 not propagated this session (governance surfaces
        `.geminirules` / `.gemini/project_state.md` in must_not_touch); cumulative
        S5 → S6 mirror delta carries to M4-C-S1 entry per F.RT.S6.M.1 carry-forward.

    Red-team: IS.8(b) sub-phase-close-class red-team conducted in-document at
    M4_B_CLOSE §7.2 (PASS_WITH_FINDINGS, 5 axes; 0 CRITICAL/HIGH; 4 findings
    classified MEDIUM/LOW/NOTE/INFO; all carry-forward with explicit dispositions).
    red_team_counter: 1 → 0 per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G discharge-of-cadence-class
    clause (sub-phase-close-class red-team treated as analogous to IS.8(b) macro-phase-
    close cadence with respect to counter-reset behavior).
  - v2.5 (2026-05-02, M4-B-P5-M4C-ENTRY-PREP): Parallel-slot governance-aside session.
    Authored as a forward-pointer slot alongside (and before) M4-B-S6 (M4-B sub-phase
    close). At my read time the file was at v2.4 (set by M4-B-P4-S6-PREDRAFT); v2.5
    is the next slot per the brief hard_constraint operational rule "check the live
    file before writing; take whatever is current + 1." S6 has not yet landed at the
    moment of this close (last commit b388350 is unrelated W7 W2-UQE work; latest
    M4-B commit is S5 b508d6e); when S6 lands it takes v2.6 (or higher) per the
    same current+1 convention.
    parallel_session_notes: This session does NOT alter canonical state pointers
    (`last_session_id`, `next_session_objective`, `active_phase_plan_sub_phase`,
    `red_team_counter`, `file_updated_at`, `file_updated_by_session` all remain as
    set by predecessor M4-B-S5-NAP-M45-EXECUTE at v2.3 and preserved by P4 at v2.4).
    The brief AC.P5.4 hard_constraint explicitly stated "session_notes: parallel
    governance slot; canonical state pointers (last_session_id, next_session_objective)
    UNCHANGED — S6 owns those" — that constraint is honored.
    Two deliverables (within may_touch only):
    (1) `00_ARCHITECTURE/PHASE_M4C_PLAN_v1_0.md` v1.0 DRAFT — M4-C execution plan.
        7 sections: §1 Scope (LL.5 retrieval ranking + LL.6 plan selection + LL.7
        discovery prior native-only mode; M4-B inputs from S5 promotion + LL.2
        shadow + LL.4 priors + LL3 recommendations; outputs as shadow registers
        for LL.5/LL.6 + single artifact for LL.7; out-of-scope explicitly named
        for LL.2 per-edge promotion + LL.3 adapters + LL.4 prompt refits + LL.7
        cohort + LL.8 + M4 macro-phase close). §2 Entry gates (M4-B closed via
        M4_B_CLOSE_v1_0.md sealed; NAP.M4.6 issued for LL.7 sub-phase only;
        Gemini reachability re-check per R.LL1TPA.1 carry-forward; SHADOW_MODE_
        PROTOCOL §3 unchanged). §3 Sub-phase plan (S1 LL.5 first shadow write;
        S2 LL.6 first shadow write; S3 NAP.M4.6 + LL.7 first artifact; S4
        sub-phase close + red-team). §4 Parallel-slot opportunities (LL.5 ⊥ LL.6
        parallel-safe; LL.7 sequenced after; S4 not parallel-safe). §5 Known
        residuals entering M4-C from M4-B (KR.M4A.RT.LOW.1 OPEN-carry-forward;
        GAP.M4A.04 PARTIAL_CLOSE deferred; R.LL1TPA.1 OPEN-carry-forward to M4-C
        entry; LL.3 §5.1 R.LL3.1/2/3 fix-before-prod at S1; LL.4 §5.4 date-precision
        global modifier informational; per-edge LL.2 promotion deferred; M4-D
        deferrals; M3 carry-throughs). §6 NAP gates (NAP.M4.6 at S3 entry;
        NAP.M4.7 at M4-D, NOT M4-C scope). §7 Changelog.
    (2) `00_ARCHITECTURE/EVAL/NAP_M4_6_BRIEF_v1_0.md` v1.0 PENDING_NATIVE_DECISION
        — decision brief for native. 5 sections: §1 What NAP.M4.6 decides
        (context: LL.7 native-only mode at M4-C; three options A/B/C presented
        structurally — A pure empirical N≥5 no classical seed; B classical-seeded
        CDLM-as-prior with confirmed/contradicted/classical_only/novel_candidate
        four-class; C discovery-first all co-activation above threshold with
        post-hoc CDLM cross-reference column). §2 Recommendation: Option B,
        grounded in four axes (discipline rule #1 priors-locked; n=1 risk + Pancha-
        MP clique sample shape; LL3 §4 finding 8 MED-tier CDLM edges already
        empirically confirmed; LL4 §3.1 classical_rule basis at 1.0 calibration).
        Trade-off acknowledgment for higher implementation cost. Reasoning against
        Options A + C at native-only n=37 scale. §3 Decision template (Option A/B/C
        verdict ≤200 char rationale; hybrid acceptable; rejection re-opens). §4
        Downstream consequences per option (algorithm at S3, expected output
        shape, S3 effort estimate 1-2 sessions, M4-D/M5 implications). §5
        Changelog.
    Read-only consumed: MACRO_PLAN §M4 + §LL-Appendix.A + §LL-Appendix.B (LL.5/
    LL.6/LL.7 rows); LL3_DOMAIN_COHERENCE §5 §4 §3.2; LL4_PREDICTION_PRIOR §5;
    SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §3 + §2 LL.7 row; PHASE_M4_PLAN.
    `00_ARCHITECTURE/CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md` v2.4 → v2.5 (this update; canonical
    state pointers UNCHANGED per AC.P5.4 hard_constraint).
    `00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_LOG.md` — entry appended.
    Out-of-scope (per brief must_not_touch): `06_LEARNING_LAYER/**`,
    `01_FACTS_LAYER/**`, `025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/**`,
    `00_ARCHITECTURE/CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.json` (S6 owns), `.geminirules`,
    `.gemini/project_state.md`, `platform/**`. Scope honored.
    No red-team this session (governance-aside class — forward-pointer plan +
    decision-pending brief; per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G governance-aside
    sessions do not increment counter). red_team_counter unchanged at 1 (set by
    S5 at v2.3; preserved at v2.4 by P4; preserved at v2.5 by this session).
    Mirror MP.1/MP.2 not propagated (governance-aside; carry-forward to next
    substantive close that already touches .geminirules / .gemini/project_state.md).
  - v2.4 (2026-05-02, M4-B-P4-S6-PREDRAFT): Parallel-slot governance-aside session
    running alongside M4-B-S5 (NAP.M4.5 native pass_2 trigger) and M4-B-P3-MIRROR-MANIFEST.
    Per brief AC.P4.3 prescription "S5→v2.1, P3→v2.2, this→v2.3" — but coordination
    re-shifted in flight: P3 landed taking v2.2; S5 landed taking v2.3 (per its own
    version_collision_note since v2.1 reservation was never picked up); v2.1 is now
    permanently vacant. This session adapts to v2.4 per the brief hard_constraint
    operational rule "check the file before writing; take whatever version is
    current + 1." At my read time the file was at v2.3; v2.4 is the next slot.
    Document this re-shift explicitly in §2 parallel_session_notes (this update).
    parallel_session_notes: This session does NOT alter canonical state pointers
    (`last_session_id`, `next_session_objective`, `active_phase_plan_sub_phase`,
    `red_team_counter`, `file_updated_at`, `file_updated_by_session` all remain as
    set by predecessor M4-B-S5-NAP-M45-EXECUTE at v2.3). The brief AC.P4.3 hard
    constraint explicitly stated "next_session_objective unchanged (S5 owns that
    pointer — do not overwrite the canonical forward pointer; leave it as M4-B-S5
    in progress)" — that pointer is now correctly set by S5 itself to M4-B-S6
    (M4-B sub-phase close) and this session preserves it.
    Single deliverable (within may_touch only): a pre-draft of the M4-B sub-phase
    sealing artifact, authored as a structural skeleton with all S5-dependent fields
    held as literal `[PENDING-S5]` tokens per the brief hard_constraint
    "Do NOT attempt to pre-decide S5's NAP.M4.5 outcome. Every S5-dependent field
    gets [PENDING-S5] with a one-line description of what it is waiting for."
    Note: S5 has in fact closed at v2.3 with NAP.M4.5 = 30/30 approved while this
    pre-draft was being authored, but per the brief constraint this pre-draft
    remains skeleton-with-tokens; S6 reads the actual S5 outcome from CURRENT_STATE
    + shadow/production files + SESSION_LOG and resolves the [PENDING-S5] tokens
    by sealing the document at S6 close (frontmatter `status: DRAFT` → `CURRENT`).
    Deliverable: `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/M4_B_CLOSE_v1_0.md`
    v1.0 DRAFT — nine-section M4-B sub-phase close artifact pre-draft. §1 scope
    (LL.1–LL.4 mechanism scope; sub-phase rounds S1–S6 + Px parallel slots;
    out-of-scope verification). §2 acceptance criteria ledger (PHASE_M4_PLAN
    AC.M4B.1–10 = 9 PASS / 1 PASS-with-PENDING-S5; per-session brief ACs PASS for
    S1–S4 + P1–P2; S5/S6 ACs marked [PENDING]). §3 deliverables inventory (12
    substantive files + 4 governance-state files + 7 file scopes verified
    untouched). §4 NAP decisions (NAP.M4.4 RESOLVED at M4-A close, binding throughout
    M4-B; NAP.M4.5 [PENDING-S5]; NAP.M4.6 + NAP.M4.7 cross-referenced as still-open).
    §5 LL status (LL.1 [PENDING-S5 — promotion count + gate status]; LL.2
    CONDITIONAL_PASS [PENDING-S5 — gate flip]; LL.3 + LL.4 COMPLETE). §6 known
    residuals carrying forward to M4-C (11 from M4-B substrate + 2 [PENDING-S5]
    + 14 inherited = 27 total). §7 red-team summary (IS.8(a) trail in M4-B; FIRES
    at S4 PASS_WITH_FINDINGS; IS.8(b) sub-phase-close [PENDING-S6 — author or
    accept-as-discharged]). §8 approval (M4-B sub-phase close = internal AC gate, no
    NAP; surrogate-disclosure ledger preserved). §9 changelog.
    `00_ARCHITECTURE/CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md` v2.3 → v2.4 (this update). New field
    `predraft_available: M4_B_CLOSE_v1_0.md` added to §2 parallel_session_notes
    block per brief AC.P4.3 ("In CURRENT_STATE, set a new field
    `predraft_available: M4_B_CLOSE_v1_0.md` so S6 knows the skeleton exists and
    should be completed rather than started fresh").
    `00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_LOG.md` — entry appended.
    Out-of-scope (per brief must_not_touch): `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/signal_weights/**`,
    `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/LL1_TWO_PASS_APPROVAL_v1_0.md`,

    No red-team this session (governance-aside class — pre-draft skeleton authoring;
    per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G substantive corpus/engine sessions increment,
    governance asides do not). red_team_counter unchanged at 1 (set by S5 at v2.3).
    Mirror MP.1/MP.2 not propagated (governance-aside; carry-forward to S6 close
    per existing convention).
  - v2.3 (2026-05-02, M4-B-S5-NAP-M45-EXECUTE): Substantive session — NAP.M4.5
    pass_2 native review DISCHARGED with 30 approved / 0 held / 0 demoted (100%);
    LL.1 production register flag flipped false→true; LL2_STABILITY_GATE
    re-evaluated CONDITIONAL_PASS→FULL_PASS; LL.4 machine-readable priors JSON
    landed; Gemini reachability check executed (NOT_REACHABLE — R.LL1TPA.1
    carry-forward to M4-C entry); F.RT.S4.1 closed via variance_estimator field.
    version_collision_note: Brief AC.S5.9 specified "CURRENT_STATE → v2.1" written
    under the assumption S5 would land before parallel-slot M4-B-P3-MIRROR-MANIFEST.
    P3 landed first taking v2.2; S5 landing later takes v2.3 to avoid version
    downgrade. v2.1 is permanently vacant in the sequence — auditable gap, not
    silent skip. Per v2.2 parallel_session_notes block "if S5 lands after,
    last writer's last_session_id / file_updated_at / red_team_counter wins;
    this session's changelog block is preserved alongside" — this v2.3 entry
    follows that guidance.
    Substantive deliverables (within may_touch only):
    (1) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/signal_weights/production/
       ll1_weights_promoted_v1_0.json` — 30 signals flipped status
       `production_pending_pass_2` → `production`; outer
       `weights_in_production_register` flipped false → true;
       `pass_2_status: approved`; per-signal `approval_chain[0].pass_2_*` fields
       populated (decision, date, session, reviewer, notes); flagged signals
       (SIG.MSR.118/.119/.143) carry the joint-question verdict in their
       pass_2_notes.
    (2) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/signal_weights/shadow/
       ll1_shadow_weights_v1_0.json` — 30 promotion-eligible signals'
       approval_chain pass_2 fields populated to match production decisions;
       outer metadata adds `variance_estimator: "sample"` (closes F.RT.S4.1
       finding from M4-B-S4 red-team).
    (3) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/LL1_TWO_PASS_APPROVAL_v1_0.md`
       v1.0 → v1.1 — frontmatter `status: PASS_1_COMPLETE_PENDING_NAP_M4_5` →
       `TWO_PASS_COMPLETE`; §5 approval_chain.pass_2 block populated with native
       verdict + joint_question_verdict_for_118_119_143 + reasoning; new §5.5
       Gemini reachability check addendum (NOT_REACHABLE; R.LL1TPA.1 carry-
       forward to M4-C entry); §6 R.LL1TPA.1 reframed as OPEN-carry-forward;
       R.LL1TPA.2 CLOSED with native verdict; v1.1 changelog appended.
    (4) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/LL2_STABILITY_GATE_v1_0.md`
       v1.0 → v1.1 — frontmatter `gate_decision: CONDITIONAL_PASS` →
       `FULL_PASS`; `re_evaluation_trigger` marked DISCHARGED; §3 decision block
       flipped (prior decision retained as audit trail); new §5.1 records the
       re-evaluation event log; §5.2 retains v1.0 trigger description; v1.1
       changelog appended. Per-edge LL.2 promotion criteria still evaluated at
       LL.2 promotion time — this gate certifies only (LL.2.e) is now satisfied
       for the 30 promoted LL.1 signals; per-edge LL.2 promotion remains future
       (out of S5 scope per must_not_touch).
    (5) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/signal_weights/
       ll4_prediction_priors_v1_0.json` NEW — machine-readable view of
       LL4_PREDICTION_PRIOR §4–§5 qualitative findings (10 domain priors;
       3 signal-class priors; date-precision global modifier). Lives in
       `signal_weights/` (not `shadow/`) per brief hard constraint — recommendation
       artifact, not weight register subject to shadow→production rules.
       Placement rationale captured in JSON metadata + LL4 §8 cross-reference.
    (6) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/LL4_PREDICTION_PRIOR_v1_0.md`
       v1.0 → v1.1 — frontmatter `version` 1.0→1.1; new
       `machine_readable_view` field; new §8 Machine-Readable Priors Cross-
       Reference (placement rationale + consumer contract); v1.1 changelog
       appended.
    (7) `00_ARCHITECTURE/EVAL/NAP_M4_5_DOSSIER_v1_0.md` — read-only consumed
       (dossier was authored at M4-B-P2; no edits to dossier this session).
    (8) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md` v2.2 → v2.3 (this update).
    (9) `00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_LOG.md` — entry appended.
    Validation: `python3 -c "json.load(...)"` on both LL.1 weight files +
    LL.4 priors JSON — all parse OK. schema_validator.py result captured at
    session_close.
    Mirror discipline: MP.1 + MP.2 NOT propagated this session (governance
    surfaces .geminirules / .gemini/project_state.md not in may_touch; mirror
    sync was discharged at parallel M4-B-P3-MIRROR-MANIFEST). LL.1 production
    register update is signal_weights/** which is not a Claude/Gemini mirror
    pair (Gemini-side does not access signal_weights per
    CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS §2 known_asymmetries) — no mirror obligation triggered.
    Red-team: NOT conducted this session. red_team_counter increments 0→1 per
    ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G (substantive learning-layer-substrate session).
    Next IS.8(a) every-third cadence-fires at counter=3 (two substantive
    sessions hence). Next session M4-B-S6 is M4-B sub-phase close — its own
    red-team will be conducted there per the brief AC.S5.9 note.
    Out-of-scope (per brief must_not_touch): `06_LEARNING_LAYER/OBSERVATIONS/**`,
    `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/signal_weights/shadow/
    ll2_edge_weights_v1_0.json`, `01_FACTS_LAYER/**`, `025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/**`,
    `00_ARCHITECTURE/CALIBRATION_RUBRIC_v1_0.md`, `platform/**`. Scope honored.
  - v2.2 (2026-05-02, M4-B-P3-MIRROR-MANIFEST, commit b41acde): Parallel-slot governance-aside session
    running alongside M4-B-S5 (NAP.M4.5 native pass_2 trigger; in flight at write time).
    Per brief AC.P3.5 ("CURRENT_STATE → v2.2 (S5 takes v2.1)"). At write time S5 had
    not yet landed; this session takes v2.2 and reserves v2.1 for S5.
    parallel_session_notes: This session does NOT alter canonical state pointers
    (`last_session_id`, `next_session_objective`, `active_phase_plan_sub_phase`,
    `red_team_counter`, `file_updated_at`, `file_updated_by_session` all remain as
    set by predecessor M4-B-S4-LL3-DOMAIN-COHERENCE at v2.0). The version increment
    reserves v2.2 in the sequence to honor the brief AC.P3.5 coordination rule.
    Two deliverables (within may_touch only):
    (1) `.geminirules` — footer narrative appended (MP.1 mirror sync). Adapted-parity
    bring-up reflecting state delta from prior MP.1 sync at M4-B-S2 (commit 568cfe3)
    through M4-B-S3 (LL.2 edge weights + KR.M4A.CLOSE.1 rubric flip), M4-B-S4
    (LL.3 + LL.4 docs + IS.8(a) red-team), M4-B-P1 (GAP.M4A.04 partial close),
    M4-B-P2 (NAP.M4.5 dossier).
    (2) `.gemini/project_state.md` — `_Last updated:_` block re-authored (MP.2
    composite mirror). Same state delta. Prior M4-B-S2 narrative retained verbatim
    in nested `_Prior session narrative retained:_` block per existing convention.
    (3) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.json` — 13 new entries registered
    (SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL_v1_0, M4_A_CLOSE_v1_0, JH_EXPORT_DISPOSITION_v1_0,
    LEL_GAP_AUDIT_v1_2, LL1_TWO_PASS_APPROVAL_v1_0, ll1_shadow_weights_v1_0,
    ll1_weights_promoted_v1_0, NAP_M4_5_DOSSIER_v1_0, LL2_EDGE_WEIGHT_DESIGN_v1_0,
    LL2_STABILITY_GATE_v1_0, ll2_edge_weights_v1_0, LL3_DOMAIN_COHERENCE_v1_0,
    LL4_PREDICTION_PRIOR_v1_0). entry_count 115→128. manifest_version 1.8→1.9.
    manifest_fingerprint extended. ll4_prediction_priors_v1_0.json deferred to S6
    manifest pass per brief (S5 in flight as concurrent session creating that file).
    Each entry's frontmatter read directly before registration per brief hard
    constraint (no memorized version strings).
    (4) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md` v2.0→v2.2 (this update; frontmatter
    version + changelog entry; no §2 canonical state pointer changes).
    (5) `00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_LOG.md` — entry appended.
    Validation: Python `json.load()` on CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.json — JSON_OK; 128
    entries; tail enumeration matches 13 new canonical_ids.
    Mirror discipline: MP.1 + MP.2 propagated this session per ND.1 (Mirror
    Discipline) bidirectional obligation. Adapted parity, not byte-identity:
    Gemini-side asymmetries (L4 Discovery focus, no signal_weights/** access)
    preserved per CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS §2 known_asymmetries.
    No red-team this session (governance-aside class — small narrative + manifest
    update; per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G substantive corpus/engine sessions
    increment, governance asides do not). red_team_counter unchanged at 0.
    Out-of-scope (per brief must_not_touch): `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/signal_weights/**`,
    `06_LEARNING_LAYER/OBSERVATIONS/**`, `01_FACTS_LAYER/**`,
    `025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/**`, `platform/**`. Brief AC.P3.7: schema_validator
    not run (lives in platform/ — must_not_touch); manifest validity confirmed via
    Python `json.load()` only.
    parallel_session_notes (S5 coordination): At write time S5 had not landed.
    If S5 lands at v2.1 chronologically before this commit, no merge action needed —
    S5 takes v2.1 and this v2.2 changelog block sits below it. If S5 lands after,
    last writer's `last_session_id` / `file_updated_at` / `red_team_counter` (if
    substantive at S5) wins; this session's changelog block is preserved alongside.
    drift_detector / mirror_enforcer to be re-run after merge.
  - v2.0 (2026-05-02, M4-B-S4-LL3-DOMAIN-COHERENCE): Clean-marker version bump after
    the parallel M4-B-S3 / P1 / P2 sessions merged into v1.7–v1.9. v2.0 marks the
    landing of M4-B-S4 — substantive learning-layer-substrate session producing two
    LL recommendation documents (LL.3 + LL.4) plus the in-session red-team obligation
    discharged at counter=3.
    Deliverables (within may_touch only):
    (1) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/LL3_DOMAIN_COHERENCE_v1_0.md` v1.0 NEW.
    Seven-section diagnostic recommendation document discharging the M4-B LL.3
    obligation per `SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §2` LL.3 row. §2 domain coverage table
    (10-bucket MSR-anchored): three buckets unobserved (family 0/20, psychological
    0/20, spiritual 0/94 = 134 of 495 MSR signals or 27% never fired in 37 training
    events); education structurally absent from MSR ontology; career fully observed
    207/207 but yields zero promotion-eligible signals (all N<3); health
    strongest empirical bucket (31/31 obs, 31 N≥3, 14 eligible); general carries
    Pancha-Mahapurusha clique (5/15 eligible incl. 3 Tier-C); relationship 39/39
    obs but 38/39 fail mean-or-variance criteria. §3 per-signal coherence: 30
    eligible signals all fire only in their declared MSR domain — verdict is
    structural by rubric design (per-event bucket filter prevents cross-domain
    actual_lit_signals), not empirical validation. §4 LL.2 edge-coherence: top-10
    edges all intra-domain (8 MED-tier are the general-bucket Pancha-Mahapurusha
    clique on SIG.MSR.117/.118/.119/.143/.145/.402; 2 LOW-tier health pairs); zero
    cross-domain by structural necessity (consistent with M4-B-S3 §3.5+§6.7
    finding). §5 recommendations: 3 fix-before-production (R.LL3.1 prod-register
    domain summary; R.LL3.2 cluster-aware consumption rule for the Pancha-MP
    clique to prevent 6× double-counting; R.LL3.3 unweighted-MSR routing with
    n=0 disclaimer for unobserved buckets) + 4 investigate-in-M5 (R.LL3.4
    multi-domain activator extension; R.LL3.5 LEL inner-life-domain expansion;
    R.LL3.6 yoga-absence M5 inspection; R.LL3.7 cross-system signal-ID
    reconciliation at M4-D). §6 5 limitations + §7 changelog. Recommendation
    document only; no shadow→production split per protocol §2.
    (2) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/LL4_PREDICTION_PRIOR_v1_0.md`
    v1.0 NEW. Six-section recommendation document discharging the M4-B LL.4
    obligation per `SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §2` LL.4 row. §2 baseline match-rate:
    training mean=0.630, held_out mean=0.913 (Δ=+0.28); gap interpreted via three
    explicit hypotheses — H1 decade-stratified-selection-bias most likely (per
    held_out_manifest selection_criteria favoring high-confidence dates +
    later-decade events + spread of categories — each correlates with higher
    achievable mr); H2 LEL retrodictive_match labeling bias secondary; H3
    honest-generalization least likely under n=37. **Held_out=0.913 explicitly
    flagged as not a clean validity figure**; training=0.630 is the more honest
    working baseline. §3 basis-class performance (training): classical_rule
    (n=29) + both (n=19) at 1.000 perfect calibration; temporal_engine (n=863)
    at 0.4267 — variance carrier of the training-mean gap; held-out sanity
    (temporal_engine n=229 at 0.5808) consistent with H1 date-precision artifact.
    §4 domain-class performance: career (n=431, 0.50), financial (n=69, 0.46),
    health (n=97, 0.49), relationship (n=124, 0.41), travel (n=5, 0.40) cluster
    in 0.40–0.50 band; general (n=168, 0.30) underperforms by Pancha-MP-cluster
    design; psy/spi/edu/fam at n≤7 with apparent 1.00 lit-rate are sample-size
    artifacts, not findings. §5 qualitative-tier prior recommendation: STRONG
    (classical_rule + both bases full credit); MODERATE (career/financial/health/
    relationship temporal — 0.4–0.5 multiplier; general temporal — 0.30 with
    cluster-aware consolidation per LL.3 R.LL3.2); WEAK (travel n=5; psy/spi/edu/
    fam n≤7 too thin); date-precision global modifier (exact → held-out band,
    approx-month → training band, approx-year further reduced). Priors are
    recommendations, not bindings; not a substitute for LL.1 weights post-NAP.M4.5.
    §6 changelog. Recommendation document only.
    (3) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md` v1.9 → v2.0 (this update).
    Frontmatter version flipped to v2.0; canonical state pointers rotated below.
    (4) `00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_LOG.md` — entry appended.
    Red-team pass (AC.S4.5; counter hits 3 = IS.8(a) every-third cadence fire).
    Conducted in-session against four axes — lel_event_match_records integrity,
    ll1_shadow_weights computation, ll2_edge_weights topology, LL1_TWO_PASS_APPROVAL
    surrogate disclosure adequacy. AXIS-1 PASS (46 records, all required fields,
    match_rate consistent, partition 37/9 correct, held-out manifest matches
    records, no missing IDs). AXIS-2 PASS (30 eligible signals all satisfy N≥3 +
    mean≥0.4 + var≤0.3; sample-recomputation matches reported stats; sample
    variance n-1 used consistently — note F.RT.S4.1 below; no held-out leakage in
    LL.1 observations). AXIS-3 PASS (9,922 edges, tier counts match summary, 0
    duplicate edges, 0 self-loops, 0 held-out leakage in co_event_ids, 8 MED-tier
    edges all on the Pancha-Mahapurusha clique with one endpoint SIG.MSR.117 not
    in the eligible set per its mean=0.36 < 0.4 status `shadow_indefinite_low_match_rate`).
    AXIS-4 PASS WITH CAVEATS (surrogate role flagged in 6 places: frontmatter
    `pass_1_reviewer_kind`, §1 disclosure paragraph, §3 rubric statement, §5
    `surrogate_disclosure` field, §6 R.LL1TPA.1 carry-forward, §7 changelog;
    structural circularity — Claude-reviewing-Claude — acknowledged via R.LL1TPA.1;
    pass_2 (NAP.M4.5 native) is the binding gate). Three findings: F.RT.S4.1
    (LOW) variance-estimator unspecified in protocol §3.1(b) — shadow file uses
    sample variance (more conservative than population); recommend protocol
    amendment at next protocol-amendment opportunity (non-blocking). F.RT.S4.2
    (NOTE) surrogate self-review structural circularity — already disclosed via
    R.LL1TPA.1; no new action. F.RT.S4.3 (INFO) domain-coherence-by-rubric-design
    acknowledged in LL3 §3.2. No HIGH/CRITICAL/MEDIUM findings; cadence
    discharged.
    Out-of-scope (per brief must_not_touch): `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/signal_weights/**`
    (no shadow or production weight files modified — LL.3/LL.4 are recommendation
    documents only); `06_LEARNING_LAYER/OBSERVATIONS/**` (read-only); `01_FACTS_LAYER/**`;
    `025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/**` (read-only for MSR domain reference);
    `00_ARCHITECTURE/CALIBRATION_RUBRIC_v1_0.md`; `platform/**`; `.geminirules`;
    `.gemini/project_state.md` — MP.1/MP.2 mirror sync not propagated this session
    (substrate session within already-discharged carry-forward window; see
    mirror_updates_propagated in SESSION_LOG entry).
    LL.2 stability gate (LL2_STABILITY_GATE_v1_0.md) re-evaluation NOT triggered
    by this session — gate re-evaluates at NAP.M4.5 close per its §5; M4-B-S4
    deliverables are recommendation documents that do not advance LL.1/LL.2
    promotion state.
  - v1.9 (2026-05-02, M4-B-P2-NAP-M45-PREP): Parallel-slot session running alongside
    M4-B-S3 (LL.2 shadow writes — reserved at v1.7) and M4-B-P1-GAP-TRAVEL-CLOSE
    (v1.8, governance-aside). Per brief AC.P2.5 ("CURRENT_STATE bumped one version
    above S3 and T2 (coordinate: if S3→v1.7 and T2→v1.8, this→v1.9); session_notes:
    parallel slot"). At write time S3 had not yet landed; this session takes v1.9.
    parallel_session_notes: This session does NOT alter canonical state
    (`last_session_id`, `next_session_objective`, `active_phase_plan_sub_phase`,
    `red_team_counter`, `file_updated_at`, `file_updated_by_session` all remain as
    set by predecessor sessions — M4-B-P1 most recently). The version increment
    reserves v1.9 in the sequence to honor the brief AC.P2.5 coordination rule.
    Single deliverable (within may_touch only): a native-facing pass_2 dossier for
    NAP.M4.5.
    Deliverable: `00_ARCHITECTURE/EVAL/NAP_M4_5_DOSSIER_v1_0.md` v1.0 — six sections.
    §1 Purpose — names NAP.M4.5 as the binding pass_2 final gate for production
    promotion of the 30 LL.1 promotion-eligible signals; pass_1 was discharged at
    M4-B-S2 by Claude-surrogate-for-Gemini.
    §2 Full 30-signal table sorted by mean_match_rate desc — columns: signal_id,
    signal_name (where MSR-resolvable), domain, N, mean, variance, tier
    (A/B/C), and NAP.M4.5 flag. Tier A = 24 (mean=1.0 var=0.0); Tier B = 3
    (mean 0.73–0.91 var 0.09–0.22); Tier C = 3 (mean 0.4545 var 0.2727).
    §3 Deep-dive on the three Tier-C flagged signals. **All three are yoga-absences:**
    SIG.MSR.118 = Ruchaka Yoga ABSENT (Mars-MP missing; Mars in Libra 7H enemy sign);
    SIG.MSR.119 = Malavya Yoga ABSENT (Venus-MP missing; Venus in Sagittarius 9H);
    SIG.MSR.143 = Sarpa Yoga ABSENT (10L Saturn exalted, opposite of debilitated).
    Full MSR_v3_0.md entries reproduced verbatim. **Joint-firing empirical analysis:**
    per-event firing matrix shows the three signals fire on largely *non-overlapping*
    subsets of the 11 training events (118∩119 = 1 event; 118∩143 = 1 event;
    119∩143 = 3 events; 118∩119∩143 = 0 events). Identical aggregate statistics
    emerge from each signal firing on its own ~5/11 subset of *different* events —
    the empirical signature of three independent phenomena, not one phenomenon
    counted three times. Native ratifies (or contests) this interpretation at
    pass_2 by inspecting whether each lit-event subset has its own thematic
    coherence given the signal's classical content.
    §4 Spot-check guide — approve / hold / demote semantics with downstream
    consequences (approve → moves to live consumption with n=1 disclaimer; hold →
    re-review at next LL refresh, blocks LL.2 endpoint-eligibility for that signal;
    demote → shadow_indefinite). Honest stakes statement: Tier-A signals carry
    overfit risk (held-out validity at M4-C is the second-line defense); Tier-C
    flagged signals carry interpretation risk (demoting all three is a defensible
    conservative outcome). Time estimate: ~20 min for a focused pass.
    §5 Blank pass_2 decision-record template — one row per signal (verdict +
    rationale ≤120 chars) + a joint-pass_2 question slot for the
    one-vs-three-phenomena answer + reviewer/date/session metadata. Filled values
    feed back into `ll1_weights_promoted_v1_0.json` `approval_chain[0].pass_2_decision`
    and `LL1_TWO_PASS_APPROVAL_v1_0.md §5.pass_2`.
    §6 Changelog.
    Read-only on `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/signal_weights/**`,

    `025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/**`, `00_ARCHITECTURE/CALIBRATION_RUBRIC_v1_0.md`,
    `platform/**` per session brief hard constraints. No red-team this session
    (governance-aside class, native-facing dossier authoring; per
    `ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES_v1_0.md §G` substantive corpus/engine sessions
    increment, governance asides do not).
  - v1.8 (2026-05-02, M4-B-P1-GAP-TRAVEL-CLOSE): Parallel-slot governance-aside session
    running alongside M4-B-S3 (LL.2 shadow writes). Discharges GAP.M4A.04 status flip
    and B.10-strict full-close attempt audit per CLAUDECODE_BRIEF M4-B-P1.
    Version-skip rationale: v1.7 is reserved for the parallel M4-B-S3 session per
    brief AC.P1.5 ("CURRENT_STATE bumped one version above whatever S3 lands on
    — coordinate: if S3 → v1.7, this → v1.8"). At write time S3 had not yet
    landed; this session takes v1.8 and S3 will take v1.7. If S3 lands first
    with a different version, merge resolution applies — this session's
    deliverables stand independent of that ordering.
    Deliverables (within may_touch only):
    (1) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/OBSERVATIONS/LEL_GAP_AUDIT_v1_0.md` v1.1 → v1.2.
    Frontmatter version + last_updated_in_session + lel_version_audited
    rotated. §5.5 added (post-LEL-v1.6-patch status flip + B.10 full-close
    attempt audit): GAP.M4A.04 status flipped `deferred-pending-patch` →
    `partially_closed` per §5.4 NAP.M4.2 status-flip protocol (LEL v1.6 patch
    confirmed landed at M4-A-CLOSE-LEL-PATCH session). §5.5 also documents the
    full-close attempt: FORENSIC §life_events does not exist (FORENSIC v8.0 is
    a chart-data file by `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_2.md §C.1` design); LEL §6
    GAP.TRAVEL_MISC.01 "possibly Russia-related business trips" is explicitly
    speculative (no dates, no destinations); LEL §4/§5/§7 surveyed and yielded
    no further B.10-compliant promotion candidates. Verdict: no source data
    exists to advance beyond `partially_closed` without B.10 violation;
    residual (international business travel, pilgrimages, US-years return
    visits) carries forward as `deferred` per NAP.M4.2 "no further elicitation
    required" clause. §5.6 final disposition tally: 1 partially_closed
    (GAP.M4A.04) + 5 deferred (GAP.M4A.01/.02/.03/.05/.06) + 5 accept
    (GAP.M4A.07–.11) + 0 infer. v1.2 changelog entry added in §8.
    (2) **LEL not modified.** Per AC.P1.4 alternative path ("PARTIAL_CLOSE with
    residual note if insufficient source data exists to add further events
    without fabrication"). LEL v1.6 stands; no v1.7 bump. AC.P1.3 N/A under
    PARTIAL_CLOSE outcome.
    (3) `00_ARCHITECTURE/CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md` v1.6 → v1.8 (this update).
    `last_session_id` → M4-B-P1-GAP-TRAVEL-CLOSE. `next_session_objective`
    pointer to M4-B-S3 unchanged (still in flight as parallel session at the
    moment of this close). `active_phase_plan_sub_phase` extended with
    GAP.M4A.04 partially_closed status. `red_team_counter` UNCHANGED at 1
    (governance-aside class — small status flip + audit refresh; per
    `ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES_v1_0.md §G` substantive corpus/engine sessions
    increment, governance asides do not). `file_updated_at` →
    2026-05-02T23:30:00+05:30. `file_updated_by_session` →
    M4-B-P1-GAP-TRAVEL-CLOSE.
    (4) `00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_LOG.md` — entry appended.
    Out-of-scope (per brief must_not_touch): `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/**`
    (live M4-B-S3 scope), `025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/**`,
    `00_ARCHITECTURE/CALIBRATION_RUBRIC_v1_0.md` (KR.M4A.CLOSE.1 still carries
    to S3), `platform/**`. Mirror MP.1/MP.2 not propagated this session — small
    governance-aside scope; carries to next substantive close.
    No red-team this session (governance aside). NAP impact: NAP.M4.2 §5.4
    patch action now **fully discharged** at the LEL_GAP_AUDIT level
    (GAP.M4A.04 status reflected as `partially_closed` in the audit; LEL v1.6
    patch already discharged the L1 side at M4-A-CLOSE-LEL-PATCH).
    parallel_session_notes: >
      Running concurrently with M4-B-S3 (LL.2 shadow writes). Both sessions
      modify CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md and SESSION_LOG.md. Version coordination
      per brief AC.P1.5: this session writes v1.8, expecting S3 to write
      v1.7. Counter coordination: this session does NOT increment
      red_team_counter (governance-aside); S3 may increment if it is a
      substantive corpus/engine session. At merge: if both sessions wrote
      conflicting `last_session_id` or `file_updated_at` values, last writer
      wins by chronological close order — operator should preserve both
      changelog entries side-by-side and re-run drift_detector after merge.

    v1.0 NEW; gate decision = CONDITIONAL_PASS (LL.2 shadow writes permitted; LL.2
    production promotion BLOCKED until NAP.M4.5 closes). §1 gate criteria (LL.2.a)–(h),
    §2 LL.1 state at gate time (30 promotion-eligible pending pass_2; 0 in production),
    §3 decision, §4 rationale incl. risk surface, §5 re-evaluation trigger (NAP.M4.5
    close auto-bumps gate to v1.1), §6 approval chain (Claude scaffold pass_1; Gemini
    red-team pass_2 pending; native implicit-no-hold), §7 3 LOW + 1 DEFERRED residuals.
    (3) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/LL2_EDGE_WEIGHT_DESIGN_v1_0.md`
    v1.0 NEW; full design doc authored BEFORE computation per AC.S3.3 hard constraint.
    §1 mechanism def (per-edge modulator on cross-domain signal graph), §2 inputs
    (lel_event_match_records primary; CDLM topology doc; msr_domain_buckets domain
    map; ll1_shadow informational endpoint annotation), §3 algorithm (deterministic
    arithmetic; cross-domain co-firing fallback; ZERO tier intentionally empty),
    **§3.5 EMPIRICAL ADJUSTMENT** added at compute time when strict cross-domain
    filter yielded 0 edges (LEL training corpus is domain-stratified — every event
    fires signals from a single domain bucket; 21 single-known-domain events + 16
    all-unknown-class events + 0 mixed). Filter relaxed to retain all non-both-unknown
    co-firing pairs with `cross_domain: bool` annotation; cross-domain semantic
    intent preserved as annotation rather than filter. §4 shadow-mode constraints,
    §5 output schema spec, §6 6 known limitations + path-protocol asymmetry
    R.LL2DESIGN.1 LOW.
    (4) `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/signal_weights/shadow/ll2_edge_weights_v1_0.json`
    NEW shadow file. **9,922 edges total** (HIGH≥8: 0; MED 4–7: 8; LOW 1–3: 9,914;
    ZERO: 0 by §3.2 design). All 9,922 edges are intra-domain (cross_domain=false)
    per the §3.5 empirical finding; cross_domain_count=0; intra_domain_count=9922.
    pairs_with_unknown_endpoint_count=0 (no event mixes known+unknown signals).
    Top-tier MED edges: SIG.MSR.145↔.402 (co=7), SIG.MSR.118↔.145 / .119↔.402 /
    .143↔.145 / .143↔.402 (co=5 each), SIG.MSR.117↔.119 / .117↔.402 / .119↔.145
    (co=4 each). 247 distinct signals appear as edge endpoints (across 6 known
    domains: career/general/health/relationship/financial/travel). Held-out
    9-event partition sacrosanct — verified by explicit partition filter; no
    held-out event ID appears in any edge's co_event_ids.
    Every edge ships with `parent_ll1_endpoints_in_production: false`,
    `promotion_eligible: false`, and `promotion_blocked_reason: "LL.1 NAP.M4.5
    pending — see LL2_STABILITY_GATE_v1_0.md §3"` per the conditional-pass gate.
    Every edge cross-references parent LL.1 endpoint state (n_observations,
    mean_match_rate, status, promotion_eligible) for audit.
    File honors B.10 (no fabricated computation): all values derived from direct
    Python read of frozen inputs. Deterministic — re-runs produce byte-identical
    output. n=1 disclaimer present in header verbatim per SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §7
    with LL.2 adaptation noting edge sparsity at n=37.
    Held-out partition sacrosanct — Learning-discipline rule #4 honored.
    last_session_id → M4-B-S3-LL2-EDGE-WEIGHTS.
    next_session_objective → M4-B-S4 (LL.3 domain-bucket coherence report +
    NAP.M4.5 prep + Gemini reachability check). LL.2 production promotion
    re-evaluates at NAP.M4.5 close per LL2_STABILITY_GATE §5.
    red_team_counter: 1 → 2 (M4-B-S3 substantive learning-layer-substrate session
    per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G; substantive sessions increment). Next IS.8(a)
    every-third cadence at counter=3 (one substantive session hence — likely M4-B-S4).
    IS.8(b) macro-phase-close cadence at M4-D close.

    No mirror_enforcer / drift_detector run at this close (governance-layer +
    learning-layer-substrate session; mirror sync MP.1+MP.2 already discharged
    at M4-B-S2-MIRROR-TWOPASS; no Claude-side governance-mirror surface touched).
    schema_validator.py at-close run: see AC.S3.8 in SESSION_LOG entry.
    Frontmatter version field: stays at 1.9 (set by parallel M4-B-P2-NAP-M45-PREP
    per its v1.9 entry coordination); my changelog entry slots into the v1.7
    reservation per parallel-coordination convention. Canonical state fields
    (last_session_id, next_session_objective, red_team_counter, file_updated_at,
    file_updated_by_session) reflect THIS session's close — overrides P1/P2's
    values per substantive-session-wins-over-governance-aside default.
  - v1.6 (2026-05-02, M4-B-S2-MIRROR-TWOPASS): MP.1+MP.2 mirror-sync carry-forward
    DISCHARGED (this session updated .geminirules + .gemini/project_state.md to adapted
    parity reflecting M4-A CLOSED + M4-B-S1 done + M4-B-S2 in flight). LL.1 two-pass
    approval pass_1 COMPLETE — pass_1 reviewer: Claude-surrogate-M4-B-S2 (surrogate-
    for-Gemini, flagged explicitly per MACRO_PLAN §Multi-Agent; Gemini unavailable
    synchronously). 30 promotion-eligible signals reviewed; 30 approved / 0 held /
    0 demoted. Demotion rule (mean<0.4 OR variance>0.3 → shadow_indefinite) re-checked
    against shadow file; not triggered for any of the 30. 3 signals (SIG.MSR.118/119/143
    Tier-C borderline; mean=0.4545 var=0.2727 N=11; identical descriptive statistics)
    flagged for NAP.M4.5 (pass_2) closer scrutiny.

    pass_1_decision="approved", pass_1_notes, pass_2_status="pending", pass_2_nap_id="NAP.M4.5").
    New file: 06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/signal_weights/production/ll1_weights_promoted_v1_0.json

    pipeline must NOT consume these weights until pass_2 sign-off.
    Held-out 9 events sacrosanct — not touched (lel_event_match_records.json untouched).
    No mirror_enforcer / drift_detector / schema_validator runs at this close (governance-

    last_session_id → M4-B-S2-MIRROR-TWOPASS.
    next_session_objective → M4-B-S3 (LL.2 shadow writes — gated on LL.1 stability per
    SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §3.5 LL.2-must-promote-after-LL.1-rule) + KR.M4A.CLOSE.1
    CALIBRATION_RUBRIC frontmatter flip (still inherited; not done this session — out of
    declared may_touch scope per brief).

  - v1.5 (2026-05-02, M4-A-CLOSE-LEL-PATCH): M4-A SUB-PHASE FORMALLY CLOSED.
    Sealing artifact produced: 00_ARCHITECTURE/M4_A_CLOSE_v1_0.md v1.0 (8 sections per
    PHASE_M4_PLAN §3.1 ACs). Quality bar: 10/10 ACs PASS (1 documentation drift carry-
    forward = KR.M4A.CLOSE.1 — CALIBRATION_RUBRIC frontmatter still reads
    AWAITING_NATIVE_APPROVAL despite NAP.M4.1 APPROVED at v1.3; semantic approval intact
    via every record's rubric_option=B; flip scheduled at M4-B entry).
    LEL v1.5 → v1.6 patch applied: GAP.M4A.04 partial close per NAP.M4.2 native disposition —
    EVT.2019.05.XX.01 (US move) and EVT.2023.05.XX.01 (India return) dual-tagged
    `category: residential+travel` with subcategory cross-reference; total events
    unchanged at 46.
    Mirror sync MP.1 (.geminirules) + MP.2 (.gemini/project_state.md): propagation
    flagged as carry-forward to next session (out of this session's may_touch scope).
    Per GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL §K.3 step 3 the next session declares the Gemini-
    side surfaces in its may_touch and updates them to adapted parity. If carry-forward
    is not picked up immediately, opens DIS.class.mirror_desync candidate.
    last_session_id → M4-A-CLOSE-LEL-PATCH.
    next_session_objective → M4-B Round 1 parallel execution: T1 (LL.1 shadow weights B1
    domains: career/financial/general/travel) + T2 (LL.1 shadow weights B2 domains:

  - v1.4 (2026-05-02, M4-A-S2-T3-SHADOW-PROTOCOL NAP-decisions): All three NAP items resolved.
    NAP.M4.4 APPROVED: SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL_v1_0.md §3 criteria binding — N≥3, variance≤0.3,
      two-pass approval, validity margin match_rate≥0.4. M4-B weight writes now unblocked.
    NAP.M4.3 Option Y: JH_EXPORT_DISPOSITION_v1_0.md §4 filled — carry forward, DIS.009 stays
      resolved-R3-pending-ECR, next pursuit window M5. KR.M3A.JH-EXPORT carries to HANDOFF_M4_TO_M5.
    NAP.M4.2 partial: LEL_GAP_AUDIT v1.0→v1.1 — GAP.M4A.04 (travel) deferred-pending-patch
      (2019/2023 events to become joint residential+travel in LEL v1.6); 5 gaps deferred; 5 accepted.
    M4-A now unblocked for close (AC.M4A.7+AC.M4A.8 DISCHARGED). red_team_counter remains 0.
    last_session_id → M4-A-S2-T3-SHADOW-PROTOCOL (NAP-decisions append).
    next_session_objective → M4-A close checklist + GAP.M4A.04 LEL patch + M4-B entry.
  - v1.3 (2026-05-02, M4-A-INTEGRATION-PASS-R3): M4-A Round 3 parallel execution complete.
    T1 (79a6810): IS.8(a) DISCHARGED — REDTEAM_M4A_v1_0.md PASS 6/6 axes; 1 LOW carry-forward

    Integration: batch1 + batch2 merged → lel_event_match_records.json (46 records, schema v1.1
      validated PASS; stray per-record schema_version stripped from 23 T1 records; partition
      EVT.2008.06.09.01 + EVT.2009.06.XX.01 flipped training→held_out per T2 manifest).
      lel_event_match_records_schema.json updated v1.0→v1.1: rubric_option (outer + per-record),
      total_events, held_out_count, training_count, held_out_manifest added to schema.

      M4-A close checklist (AC.M4A.2–AC.M4A.10) + M4-B entry (LL.1 shadow-mode writes).
  - v1.2 (2026-05-02, M4-A-INTEGRATION-PASS): M4-A Round 2 parallel execution complete.
    T1 (5d015bd): LEL v1.3→v1.4 (11 events Swiss Ephemeris computed, AC.M4A.1 discharged).

    Integration: LEL §9 migrated:true annotations (v1.4→v1.5). red_team_counter: 2→3
    (IS.8(a) cadence-pending — due at M4-A-S2 open). last_session_id →

  - v1.1 (2026-05-01, M4-INFRA-001): Added Platform State block recording migrations 022-031 applied to Cloud SQL.
  - v1.0 (2026-04-24, Step 10 of the Step 0 → Step 15 governance rebuild):
      Initial state file. §2 canonical state block (YAML) populated to reflect the moment
      of this Step 10 close: M2 paused, PHASE_B_PLAN v1.0.2 paused, Step 10 completed,
      Step 11 ready, last_session_id = STEP_10_SESSION_LOG_SCHEMA, next_session_objective
      = "Execute Step 11 — Learning Layer scaffold decision". §3 narrative supplements
      the YAML with the human-reading rationale. §4 update-rules spell out how subsequent
      sessions maintain the file. §5 disagreement-resolution rule names STEP_LEDGER as
      authoritative during the rebuild era; post-Step-15, THIS file is authoritative.
  - v1.0 amended-in-place (2026-04-24, Step 15 close — STEP_15_GOVERNANCE_BASELINE_CLOSE):
      State-block transition to GOVERNANCE_CLOSED. §2 YAML: active_governance_step → Step_15
      completed; active_macro_phase_status → active; active_phase_plan_version → 1.0.3

      last_session_id → STEP_15_GOVERNANCE_BASELINE_CLOSE; next_session_objective →
      PHASE_B_PLAN v1.0.3 amendment. §3 narrative refreshed to reflect rebuild closed and M2
      active. §5.1 note updated to reflect §5.2 (CURRENT_STATE) now in force.

# CURRENT STATE v1.0
## MARSYS-JIS Project — Canonical "You Are Here" Pointer

*Implements GA.19 at the full-surface layer per `GROUNDING_AUDIT_v1_0.md §6.3` +
`GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL_v1_0.md §I.5`. Companion to `SESSION_LOG_SCHEMA_v1_0.md`
(GA.17 + GA.18 closure). Produced in Step 10 of the Step 0 → Step 15 governance rebuild.*

---

## §1 — How to read this file

- **§2** is the canonical machine-readable state block. A YAML fence. The fields it carries
  are the authoritative current state of the project at the moment of the last session close.
- **§3** is a human-readable narrative derived from §2. Reading §3 answers "what is actually
  going on" in prose; reading §2 answers the same question in a form `drift_detector.py` can
  parse. The two must agree.
- **§4** spells out the update protocol: who touches the file, when, and how a session
  verifies consistency.
- **§5** names the disagreement-resolution rule: during the rebuild era, STEP_LEDGER wins
  conflicts; post-Step-15, this file wins.

A fresh session that opens the project and wants to know "where are we now?" reads §2, cross-
checks against STEP_LEDGER (during rebuild era) or against SESSION_LOG's latest `session_close`
block (post-rebuild era), and proceeds.

    session AND M3 MACRO-PHASE CLOSE. Four deliverables per brief Gate 4:
    DELIVERABLE 1 (M3_CLOSE):
      - 00_ARCHITECTURE/M3_CLOSE_v1_0.md (NEW): sealing artifact for M3.
        §1 quality bar — 27 PASS / 1 DEFERRED (AC.M3A.5; native-accepted)
        / 1 PASS+DEFERRED-PARTIAL (AC.M3D.3 external acharya) / 0 FAIL.
        §2 wave log — W1 (M3-OPEN + M3-A 5 sessions); W2 (M3-B 2
        sessions); W3 (M3-C 3 sessions); W4 (M3-D 3 sessions including
        M3-PRE-D-GOVERNANCE + D1 + D2). §3 deferred items — 13 items
        across "inherited from M3 sub-phases" (KR.M3.RT.LOW.1, JH-EXPORT,
        DIS.010/011/012-N3, Sthana+Drik ECR, Narayana ECR, KR.M3A2.1,
        Shadbala convention findings, AC.M3A.5, R.M3D.1 external
        acharya) and "inherited from M2" (SIG.MSR.207, UCN inline citation,
        TS test-fixture errors, KR.W9.1+KR.W9.2). §4 red-team evidence —
        REDTEAM_M3 PASS 9/9 axes; counter trail in M3 detailed. §5 ND
        status — open=[]; addressed=[ND.1]. §6 mirror sync evidence —
        MP.1 + MP.2 same-session. §7 live platform state. §8 M3 exit
        confirmed; M4 may now open.
    DELIVERABLE 2 (HANDOFF_M3_TO_M4):
      - 00_ARCHITECTURE/HANDOFF_M3_TO_M4_v1_0.md (NEW): handoff memo.

        tools; 5 M3 temporal tables; CAPABILITY_MANIFEST 112 entries;
        4 DISCOVERY_*_ENABLED flags default-true). What M4 needs to
        know (LEL ground-truth spine; per-signal calibration weights;
        LL.1-LL.4 STUB→active; held-out cohort discipline; JH
        integration scope decision). HARD PREREQUISITES for M4:
        LEL ≥40 events spanning ≥5 years (current 35; 5-event gap;
        native owns gate-clearance). Inherited open items by owner
        (native | next-session | M9-class | Portal R-stream). Active
        feature flags. Active disagreements (DIS.009 resolved-R3-
        pending-ECR; DIS.010/011/012 resolved-N3). Concurrent workstreams.
        Operational checklist for M4 (16 inheritance items).

    M5-S1 — open M5 macro-phase. First-session scope per MACRO_PLAN §M5
    (Probabilistic Engine — DBN topology + signal-embedding refit-stability test
    design + CW.PPL volume gate verification). At session-open: read MACRO_PLAN
    §M5 in full + M4_CLOSE §5 (M5 setup recommendations 8 items) + HANDOFF
    pointer in M4_CLOSE §1 (LL.1–LL.7 final state). Decide whether to expand
    MACRO_PLAN §M5 into PHASE_M5_PLAN_v1_0.md (analogue of PHASE_M4_PLAN +
    PHASE_M3_PLAN) or drive M5 directly from MACRO_PLAN — decision at M5 open
    per CURRENT_STATE narrative precedent of M3 → M4 transition.
    M5-S1 priority order per M4_CLOSE §5: (1) PHASE_M5_PLAN authoring;
    (2) PPL volume-gate verification (current 16 predictions vs ≥50 target with

    (3) consume M4-D-P1 patched CDLM v1.3 + re-emit ll7_discovery_prior over

    LL1_TWO_PASS_APPROVAL §5.5; if REACHABLE in M5+, retroactive ratification
    of accumulated M4 surrogate decisions per GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL

    Drik Shadbala ECR + Narayana Dasha verification — external-computation
    items per NAP.M4.3 Option Y); (6) LL.3 fix-before-prod recommendations
    (R.LL3.1/.2/.3 retrieval-pipeline change); (7) LL.2 per-edge promotion
    campaign for 8 MED-tier Pancha-MP anchors (and any LL.7 flips from novel
    → confirmed post-CDLM-patch); (8) MSR signal-completeness pass
    (SIG.MSR.207/497/498/499 absent from MSR_v3_0.md).

      (b) M4-B sub-phase-close red-team — per the M4-B-S5 brief AC.S5.9 note,
          M4-B sub-phase close requires its own red-team (treated as analogue
          to IS.8(b) macro-phase-close discipline at sub-phase granularity,
          even though red_team_counter is at 1 not 3). Axes to cover: LL.1
          production register correctness (30 signals consumable);
          LL2_STABILITY_GATE FULL_PASS soundness; LL.3/LL.4 recommendation
          completeness; R.LL1TPA.1 carry-forward audit-trail discipline;
          held-out partition discipline (still sacrosanct); cross-system

          active_phase_plan_sub_phase to "M4-C — Calibration Validity Test
          (in flight)". M4-C entry unblocked.

    M4-B-S5 scope (parallel-safe; brief authoring at session open):
      (a) NAP.M4.5 native-review trigger preparation. The dossier
          (NAP_M4_5_DOSSIER_v1_0.md) authored at M4-B-P2 is well-formed; M4-B-S5
          formal trigger involves: confirm dossier hasn't drifted from
          ll1_shadow_weights, surface the 3 Tier-C joint-firing question to native
          synchronously, capture native pass_2 verdicts in the dossier §5 template,
          and write back to ll1_weights_promoted_v1_0.json approval_chain. Once
          NAP.M4.5 closes, LL2_STABILITY_GATE re-evaluates per its §5 (auto-bumps
          to v1.1 with PASS / PARTIAL_PASS / HOLD-FAIL decision). LL.1 production
          register flag flips on full pass_2 approval.
      (b) Gemini reachability check. If Gemini becomes synchronously reachable in
          this session, append the addendum to LL1_TWO_PASS_APPROVAL_v1_0.md §5 per
          its own §6.1 self-rule, plus the addendum to LL2_STABILITY_GATE §6.1 per

          open DIS.class.output_conflict per GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL §K.3.
      (c) (optional) LL.4 follow-through. If the M4-B-S5 brief expands LL.4, the
          recommendation document at LL4_PREDICTION_PRIOR_v1_0.md may receive a
          v1.1 amendment incorporating any prior-fitting first-pass numerical
          coefficients per its §5 framing. Default: do not amend; LL.5/LL.6
          numerical fitting waits for prediction-ledger accumulation.

    M4-B-S4 scope:
      (a) LL.3 — Embedding-space-adaptation note. Per SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §2 LL.3 row,
          LL.3 output at M4-B is `06_LEARNING_LAYER/EMBEDDING_SPACE_ADAPTATION/
          adaptation_notes_M4B_v1_0.md` — a structured recommendation document, NOT an
          adapter weight artifact. Domain-bucket coherence report: for each domain
          bucket in msr_domain_buckets.json, audit how well the bucket's signals
          cohere semantically (do similar-meaning signals cluster? are outliers
          actually mis-bucketed? what re-bucketing would the embedding space suggest?).
          Output is a recommendation document; no adapter weights, no shadow→
          production split (those come at M5+ when adapters are emitted).
      (b) NAP.M4.5 prep cross-check. Verify the dossier produced at M4-B-P2-NAP-M45-PREP
          (NAP_M4_5_DOSSIER_v1_0.md) is well-formed and ready for native pass_2 review.
          If Gemini becomes synchronously reachable in this session, append the
          Gemini-reachability addendum to LL1_TWO_PASS_APPROVAL_v1_0.md §5 per its
          own §6.1 self-rule, and re-evaluate Tier-C joint-firing question.
      (c) (optional, parallel-safe) LL.4 — Prompt optimization record at M4-B.
          Output: `06_LEARNING_LAYER/PROMPT_OPTIMIZATION/prompt_opt_record_M4B_v1_0.md`
          per SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §2 LL.4 row — recording proposed amendments;
          amendments ship via feature flag, not shadow→production split.
    LL.2 stability gate (LL2_STABILITY_GATE_v1_0.md) re-evaluates at NAP.M4.5 close
      per its §5; M4-B-S4 does not advance LL.2 promotion state on its own.
    Inherited carry-forwards (unchanged):
      - NAP.M4.5 (M4-B-class) native spot-check on LL.1 weights at M4-B close — pass_2
        of two-pass discipline; binding final gate for LL.1 production promotion.
        Dossier authored at M4-B-P2: 00_ARCHITECTURE/EVAL/NAP_M4_5_DOSSIER_v1_0.md.

      - KR.M4A.RT.LOW.1 schedule tree-rewrite for commit 0793719 (not blocking).
      - R.LL2DESIGN.1 (LOW) — LL.2 shadow path co-located with LL.1 (signal_weights/shadow)
        rather than at SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §2's declared GRAPH_EDGE_WEIGHT_LEARNING/
        edge_modulators/shadow/ — resolution at next M4-B governance pass.
      - GAP.M4A.04 partially_closed (residual deferred per NAP.M4.2; no further
        elicitation per native disposition).
      - msr_domain_buckets: 4 absent signal IDs (SIG.MSR.207/497/498/499) flagged for M5+.
      - Domain-stratified LEL training corpus finding (LL2_EDGE_WEIGHT_DESIGN §3.5+§6.7) —
        flag for M4-D cross-system reconciliation pass.
    red_team_counter: 2 (M4-B-S3 substantive). Next IS.8(a) cadence-fires at counter=3
      (one substantive session hence — likely M4-B-S4 if LL.3 work is substantive).
      IS.8(b) macro-phase-close at M4-D.
    === Predecessor next_session_objective (M4-B-S3 path) preserved for audit trail ===
    M4-B-S3 — LL.2 GRAPH EDGE WEIGHT MODULATORS (shadow-mode) + CALIBRATION_RUBRIC FRONTMATTER FLIP (KR.M4A.CLOSE.1).
    Predecessor: M4-B-S2-MIRROR-TWOPASS (2026-05-02 — MP.1+MP.2 mirror sync DISCHARGED;
    LL.1 two-pass approval pass_1 COMPLETE — 30 signals approved by Claude-surrogate-for-Gemini
    pending pass_2 NAP.M4.5 native spot-check at M4-B close; production_pending file
    signal_weights/production/ll1_weights_promoted_v1_0.json carries
    status: "production_pending_pass_2"; CURRENT_STATE v1.6).
    M4-B-S3 scope per SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §3.5 LL.2 promotion-precondition rule:
      (a) LL.1 stability gate — assert LL.1 shadow weights have not regressed since
          M4-B-S1 write (no LEL version delta exceeding kill-switch §4(c) threshold;
          no DIS calibration entry opened; spot-check 30 promotion-eligible signals
          for variance/mean stability against shadow file). Document gate verdict in
          SESSION_LOG before first LL.2 shadow write per AC.M4B.3.
      (b) LL.2 shadow register creation —
          06_LEARNING_LAYER/GRAPH_EDGE_WEIGHT_LEARNING/edge_modulators/shadow/.
          Per-edge modulators keyed by edge ID (CGM edge or pair (signal_a, signal_b)).
      (c) Initial LL.2 shadow write — only edges where both endpoint signals appear
          in LL.1 promotion_eligible_pending_two_pass set are eligible candidates;
          per §3.5 LL.2 endpoint-pair rule, edge promotion is gated on both endpoints
          being in production register (which is itself pass_2-gated, so LL.2
          promotion blocks until LL.1 pass_2 NAP.M4.5 resolves).

    === Predecessor next_session_objective (M4-A close path) preserved for audit trail ===
    M4-B-S2 — TWO-PASS APPROVAL + NATIVE NOTIFICATION + SINGLE-TRACK / B1+B2 RECONCILIATION.
    Predecessor: M4-A-CLOSE-LEL-PATCH (2026-05-02 — M4-A formally closed; sealing artifact
    M4_A_CLOSE_v1_0.md; LEL v1.6 patch applied; CURRENT_STATE v1.5).
    PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITY DOCUMENTED IN M4_A_CLOSE §8: M4-B-S1-LL1-SHADOW-WEIGHTS executed
    AHEAD of this M4-A formal close at commit 550fa77 (hash-stamp follow-up efa599c). Single-
    track LL.1 shadow-write (380 signals; 30 promotion-eligible pending two-pass; held-out 9
    events excluded — Learning Layer discipline #4 respected; no production promotion). The
    BRIEF for this session prescribed `M4-B Round 1 parallel execution (B1+B2)` as the next
    objective — that text is preserved in the predecessor next_session_objective audit trail
    below for governance traceability — but the FACTUAL next session is M4-B-S2 follow-up
    work, not M4-B-R1 fresh entry.
    M4-B-S2 scope:
      (a) §3(c) two-pass approval — Gemini red-team review on the 30
          promotion_eligible_pending_two_pass signals per SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §3.
      (b) §3(d) native-notification with no-hold gate per SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §3.
      (c) Native review of M4-B-S1 single-track implementation vs the planned B1/B2 split —
          accept-as-is OR schedule a B1/B2 re-split pass.
      (d) KR.M4A.CLOSE.1 — flip CALIBRATION_RUBRIC_v1_0.md frontmatter status
          AWAITING_NATIVE_APPROVAL → APPROVED, version 1.0-DRAFT → 1.0, append changelog
          entry citing NAP.M4.1 approval (2026-05-02).
      (e) MP.1 + MP.2 mirror sync carry-forward from M4-A close — declare .geminirules and
          .gemini/project_state.md in may_touch and update to adapted parity reflecting
          M4-A CLOSED + M4-B-S1 done + M4-B-S2 in flight.
      (f) LL.2 / LL.3 / LL.4 mechanism activation per PHASE_M4_PLAN §3.2 (parallelizable
          with the two-pass approval work).
    Acceptance criteria: PHASE_M4_PLAN §3.2 AC.M4B.1–AC.M4B.10 continue to govern; shadow-
    only writes per SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §3 until promotion criteria are met (N≥3,
    variance≤0.3, two-pass approval, validity margin match_rate≥0.4).
    Mirror sync MP.1 + MP.2 carry-forward from M4-A close: M4-B Round 1 entry session
      declares .geminirules + .gemini/project_state.md in may_touch and updates them
      to adapted parity reflecting M4-A CLOSED + M4-B in-flight (per

  # ------------------------------------------------------------------
  parallel_session_notes: >
    M4-D-S1 (this update at v3.4) ran as a single-substantive close-class session
    coordinated with the parallel-slot governance-aside M4-D-P1-CDLM-PATCH (v3.3
    predecessor). Per the operational rule "current+1" this S1 takes v3.4 (P1
    took v3.3; M4-C-S4 took v3.2). Canonical pointers ROTATED per W6: last_session_id
    → M4-D-S1; next_session_objective → M5-S1; active_macro_phase M4 → M5;
    active_macro_phase_status → closed/incoming; active_phase_plan_status →
    COMPLETE. M4-D-P1's v3.3 deliverables (CDLM v1.2 → v1.3 patch; manifest
    CDLM entry version + v2.3 → v2.4) are read into this v3.4 update for
    coordination — manifest bumped further v2.4 → v2.5 per last-writer-wins
    convention (entry_count 137 → 138; M4_CLOSE_v1_0 entry registered;
    manifest_fingerprint extended). M4-D-S1 must_not_touch 025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/
    per brief — CF.LL7.1 substrate already discharged at P1; no further CDLM
    touches until M5 expansion pass per OPEN_ITEM.P1.1. schema_validator.py
    re-run at this M4-D-S1 close per W10 (baseline 108 violations target;
    halt-and-report if count increases). drift_detector.py / mirror_enforcer.py
    NOT re-run (out of W10 scope — schema validation only per execution brief;
    both at last-known state from M4-C-S2/S3/S4 verifications + M4-D-P1 schema
    check).
    === Predecessor parallel_session_notes block (M4-D-P1 + S4 audit trail) preserved ===
    M4-D-P1-CDLM-PATCH (v3.3 predecessor) ran as a PARALLEL-SLOT GOVERNANCE-ASIDE
    session alongside this M4-D-S1 (M4 macro-phase close). P1 took v3.3 with
    canonical pointers UNCHANGED per its AC.P1.7 hard_constraint (last_session_id
    stayed M4-C-S4-CLOSE; next_session_objective stayed M4-D-S1). M4-D-P1
    discharged CF.LL7.1 substrate (CDLM v1.2 → v1.3; msr_anchors append for
    MSR.117/118/119/143 to D1.D1/D5.D5/D5.D6/D5.D7; OPEN_ITEM.P1.1 MSR.145
    cell absent carries to M5 CDLM expansion). Manifest CDLM entry version
    1.2 → 1.3; manifest top-level v2.3 → v2.4. Counter unchanged at 0
    (governance-aside class). This M4-D-S1 coordinates by reading P1's v3.3 +
    v2.4 deltas + bumping CURRENT_STATE v3.3 → v3.4 + manifest v2.4 → v2.5.
    === Predecessor parallel_session_notes block (S4 single-track, v3.2) preserved for audit trail ===
    M4-C-S4-CLOSE (predecessor at v3.2) ran as a SINGLE-TRACK SUB-PHASE CLOSE-CLASS
    session; no parallel slots open at S4 entry. The two preceding governance-aside
    parallel slots (M4-C-P6-S4-PREDRAFT 2026-05-03 commit 0934efb authoring
    M4_C_CLOSE pre-draft; M4-C-P7-M4D-ENTRY-PREP 2026-05-02 v3.1 authoring
    PHASE_M4D_PLAN + NAP_M4_7_BRIEF) preceded this S4 close chronologically; their
    pre-drafts were respectively CONSUMED at this S4 (M4_C_CLOSE sealed DRAFT →
    CLOSED) and remain pending consumption at M4-D-S1 (PHASE_M4D_PLAN +
    NAP_M4_7_BRIEF). drift_detector.py / schema_validator.py / mirror_enforcer.py
    re-run at this S4 close per AC.S4.9 baseline target (108 violations).
    === Predecessor parallel_session_notes block (P7 governance aside, v3.1) preserved for audit trail ===
    M4-C-P7-M4D-ENTRY-PREP (this update at v3.1) ran as a PARALLEL GOVERNANCE
    SLOT alongside M4-C-S4 (M4-C sub-phase close — not yet landed at this
    session's open). Same convention as M4-B-P5-M4C-ENTRY-PREP (parallel to
    M4-B-S6; PHASE_M4C_PLAN + NAP_M4_6_BRIEF forward-pointer pair) and
    M4-C-P6-S4-PREDRAFT (parallel to M4-C-S3; M4_C_CLOSE pre-draft skeleton).
    Conflict surfaces: CURRENT_STATE.md (this session sets v3.1 with canonical
    pointers UNCHANGED per AC.P7.4 hard_constraint — `last_session_id`,
    `next_session_objective`, `active_phase_plan_sub_phase`, `red_team_counter`,
    `file_updated_at`, `file_updated_by_session` all remain as set by
    M4-C-S3-LL7-DISCOVERY-PRIOR; S4 will read live state and adapt to v3.2+
    per the operational rule "current+1"); SESSION_LOG.md (this session
    appends its own entry; S4's entry is independent); CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.json
    (NOT touched per brief must_not_touch — S4 may touch); MACRO_PLAN_v2_0.md
    (NOT touched — S4 owns naming propagation for R.LL5DESIGN.1 / R.LL6DESIGN.1).
    drift_detector.py / schema_validator.py / mirror_enforcer.py to be re-run
    at M4-C-S4 sub-phase close to confirm no cross-check regression. Both
    pre-drafts (M4_C_CLOSE_v1_0.md from P6 + PHASE_M4D_PLAN_v1_0.md from this
    P7) remain pending consumption: M4_C_CLOSE consumed at M4-C-S4 sealing;
    PHASE_M4D_PLAN consumed at M4-D-S1 macro-phase close. NAP_M4_7_BRIEF
    PENDING_NATIVE_DECISION presented at M4-D-S1.
    === Predecessor parallel_session_notes block (S3 single-track, v3.0) preserved for audit trail ===
    NONE — M4-C-S3-LL7-DISCOVERY-PRIOR ran single-track (sequential after the
    M4-C-S1+S2 parallel-pair landed at v2.8/v2.9 on 2026-05-02). The prior
    M4-C-S1+S2 parallel-pair coordination block is removed at v3.0 close per
    the transient-block-removal convention. Both v2.8 (S1) and v2.9 (S2)
    remain audit-trailed in the changelog list above.
    === Predecessor parallel_session_notes (S1+S2 race, 2026-05-02) preserved for audit trail ===
    M4-C-S1-LL5-DASHA-TRANSIT and M4-C-S2-LL6-TEMPORAL-DENSITY ran as parallel-safe
    substantive learning-layer-substrate sessions per PHASE_M4C_PLAN_v1_0.md §4
    (LL.5 ⊥ LL.6 ruling; disjoint file scopes by may_touch declaration). Conflict
    surface: CURRENT_STATE.md (this file) + SESSION_LOG.md + CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.json
    (the latter explicitly assigned to S2 per S1 AC.S1.6 hard_constraint).
    Race outcome: S1 landed first (v2.7 → v2.8 frontmatter + v2.8 changelog +
    last_session_id rotated to M4-C-S1 + red_team_counter 0→1 + active_phase_plan_sub_phase
    rewritten + file_updated_at rotated to S1 timestamp). S2 (this update) reads
    live state and adapts: takes v2.9 (current+1; v2.8 is S1's just-landed slot);
    bumps red_team_counter 1→2 (substantive increment from S1's post-write value);
    overwrites last_session_id to M4-C-S2 (chronologically-later close per the
    last-writer-wins convention used in M4-B-P1/S3 pair); rewrites
    next_session_objective to M4-C-S3 (LL.7 first artifact write); rewrites
    active_phase_plan_sub_phase to reflect both first-shadow-write sessions
    closed; rotates file_updated_at + file_updated_by_session to S2 timestamp +
    session_id; replaces this parallel_session_notes block. S1's deliverables
    remain fully audit-trailed in v2.8 changelog block (preserved verbatim);
    S2's deliverables in v2.9 block above. Manifest: S1 brief explicitly
    deferred manifest-touch (must_not_touch CAPABILITY_MANIFEST per S1 AC.S1.6);
    S2 brief AC.S2.4 mandates registration of BOTH S1 + S2 LL pairs in one pass —
    discharged at this session at v2.0 → v2.1 with 4 entries
    (LL5_DASHA_TRANSIT_DESIGN, ll5_dasha_transit, LL6_TEMPORAL_DENSITY_DESIGN,
    ll6_temporal_density). Mirror MP.1+MP.2: discharged at S1 v2.8 close
    (`.geminirules` + `.gemini/project_state.md` updated to adapted parity
    reflecting M4-B CLOSED + M4-C-S1 in flight + LL.1–LL.4 production-state +
    LL.5–LL.7 incoming); S2 must_not_touch the mirror surfaces — no further
    propagation this session. drift_detector.py / schema_validator.py /
    mirror_enforcer.py to be re-run post-commit to confirm no cross-check regression.
    This block is transient and may be removed at the next steady-state
    close once the M4-C parallel-pair coordination phase has fully settled
    (likely at M4-C-S3 close or M4-C-S4 sub-phase close).

## §3 — Narrative (human-reading surface — must agree with §2)

At the close of **M4-B-S6-CLOSE (2026-05-03) — M4-B SUB-PHASE CLOSED (sealing artifact M4_B_CLOSE_v1_0.md sealed; IS.8(b)-class red-team conducted)**:

**Sub-phase.** **M4-B SUB-PHASE CLOSED 2026-05-03.** This is the substantive close-class session sealing M4-B (Learning Layer Activation — LL.1 per-signal weight calibration in shadow + LL.1 production promotion at S5 + LL.2 shadow + LL.3 + LL.4 recommendation documents + LL.4 priors machine-readable JSON + binding `SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §3` discipline + held-out 9-event partition sacrosanct throughout + two-pass approval discharged complete). Sealing artifact: `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/M4_B_CLOSE_v1_0.md` v1.0 SEAL.

**M4-B sealing path (a) — full PASS.** NAP.M4.5 native pass_2 verdict at M4-B-S5 (commit b508d6e, 2026-05-02): 30 of 30 promotion-eligible LL.1 signals approved / 0 held / 0 demoted (100%, exceeds the ≥90% FULL_PASS threshold). Joint Tier-C question on SIG.MSR.118/.119/.143 yoga-absences: native verdict (a) three independent calibrated phenomena. LL.1 production register flag flipped (per-signal `status: production` for all 30; outer `weights_in_production_register: true`). LL2_STABILITY_GATE re-evaluated CONDITIONAL_PASS → **FULL_PASS** (v1.0 → v1.1; gate-level promotion-block lifted; per-edge LL.2 promotion deferred to M4-C). LL1_TWO_PASS_APPROVAL v1.0 → v1.1 TWO_PASS_COMPLETE. LL4_PREDICTION_PRIOR v1.0 → v1.1 with new §8 cross-reference + companion `ll4_prediction_priors_v1_0.json` machine-readable view (10 domain priors + 3 signal-class priors + date-precision modifier). F.RT.S4.1 (LOW from M4-B-S4 red-team) CLOSED via `variance_estimator: "sample"` field on shadow file outer metadata. Gemini reachability NOT_REACHABLE — R.LL1TPA.1 carries to M4-C entry as a re-attempt obligation.

**IS.8(b)-class M4-B sub-phase-close red-team.** Conducted **in-document at `M4_B_CLOSE §7.2`** (rather than authoring a standalone `REDTEAM_M4B_v1_0.md` file — analogue of in-session IS.8(a) discharge precedent extended to sub-phase-close granularity at PASS_WITH_FINDINGS). 5 axes: (a) LL.1 promotion integrity (30/30 status=production; pass_2_decision=approved; flagged signals carry joint-firing verdict); (b) LL.2 stability gate integrity (FULL_PASS frontmatter; trigger DISCHARGED; ll2_edge_weights outer metadata correct); (c) CAPABILITY_MANIFEST completeness (entry_count 129; manifest_version 2.0; all M4-B canonical_ids registered; new ll4_prediction_priors entry verified); (d) held-out partition sacrosanct (9/9 records carry partition: held_out; 3-of-9 spot-check verified); (e) session version sequence (v2.1 vacated gap auditable; v2.0→v2.2→v2.3→v2.4→v2.5→v2.6 chain documented per session changelog blocks). **Verdict: PASS_WITH_FINDINGS.** 0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH; 4 findings classified — F.RT.S6.M.1 MEDIUM (mirror staleness on M4-B-CLOSED checkpoint; carry to M4-C-S1 entry sync), F.RT.S6.M.2 LOW (M4_B_CLOSE manifest entry not yet registered; carry to next manifest touch), F.RT.S6.N.1 NOTE (parallel-session version-coordination convention not formalized in top-level governance; carry to next quarterly governance pass 2026-07-24), F.RT.S6.I.1 INFO (outer-metadata stale-doc-hint on `production_status_field_value` field; carry to next LL.1 production-register touch). All carry-forward with explicit dispositions; no finding gates close.

**CAPABILITY_MANIFEST v1.9 → v2.0.** Clean M4-B-close marker. Registered the deferred `ll4_prediction_priors_v1_0` canonical entry (path: `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/signal_weights/ll4_prediction_priors_v1_0.json`; status CURRENT; layer L_LEARNING; phase M4-B). entry_count 128 → 129; manifest_fingerprint extended with `+m4b_s6_close_2026-05-03`. Python `json.load()` parse-clean.

**Schema validator: 112 → 108 baseline.** Three structural fixes in SESSION_LOG: (a) M4-B-P3-MIRROR-MANIFEST entry: missing session_open YAML reconstructed retroactively (closes 1 CRITICAL `session_log_entry_missing_session_open_yaml`); (b) M4-B-P4-S6-PREDRAFT entry heading: `## 2026-05-02 — M4-B-P4-S6-PREDRAFT — ...` → `## M4-B-P4-S6-PREDRAFT — ...` (closes 2 HIGH heading-vs-session-id disagreements on open + close); (c) M4-B-P4-S6-PREDRAFT entry body: `### Next session objective` heading added (closes 1 LOW `session_log_entry_missing_next_objective_heading`). Net schema_validator went 112 → 108 — matches the 108-baseline established at M3-W4-D2-M3-CLOSE and carried through M4-B-S3/S4 closes (per `ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §F` known-residuals whitelist for the pre-M4-B baseline). Exit code 2 (HIGH-class baseline; same as predecessor closes); AC.S6.4 target met.

**Mirror sync (MP.1/MP.2).** **NOT propagated** this session per brief `must_not_touch` declaration (`.geminirules` and `.gemini/project_state.md` excluded from S6 may_touch). The cumulative S5 → S6 mirror delta (production-flag flip; FULL_PASS gate flip; LL.4 priors JSON; CURRENT_STATE v2.4 → v2.6; M4-B CLOSED status) carries forward to **M4-C-S1 entry** for the next adapted-parity propagation cycle. Recorded as F.RT.S6.M.1 MEDIUM finding in §7.2 with explicit M4-C-S1 carry-forward.

**Files changed (within may_touch only).**
- `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/M4_B_CLOSE_v1_0.md` — MODIFIED (status DRAFT → CLOSED; sealed_by + sealed_at frontmatter fields added; red_team_artifact updated to cite §7.2; executive summary rewritten; §1.2 sub-phase rounds table filled for S5/P3/S6; §2 AC ledger flipped to 10/10 PASS + S5/S6 PASS verdicts; §3 deliverables inventory updated; §4.2 NAP.M4.5 RESOLVED with disposition ledger; §5 LL status flipped to PRODUCTION/FULL_PASS/COMPLETE; §6.1 F.RT.S4.1 CLOSED; §6.2 [PENDING-S5] dependents resolved; §7.1 cadence trail filled; §7.2 IS.8(b) red-team conducted in-document with 4-finding classification; §7.3 counter-at-close + cadence forecast; §8 approval ledger discharge clean; §9 v1.0 SEAL changelog entry added).
- `00_ARCHITECTURE/CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.json` — MODIFIED (v1.9 → v2.0; entry_count 128 → 129; +1 entry ll4_prediction_priors_v1_0; manifest_fingerprint extended; last_updated rotated).
- `00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_LOG.md` — MODIFIED (P3 entry session_open YAML reconstructed; P4 entry heading + next-objective heading fixed; M4-B-S6-CLOSE entry appended).
- `00_ARCHITECTURE/CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md` — MODIFIED (v2.5 → v2.6; §2 canonical state pointers rotated per AC.S6.5; predraft_available field cleared; cross_check_hash updated to last_session_id=M4-B-S6-CLOSE; §3 narrative top entry replaced).

**Out-of-scope, deliberately not touched (per brief must_not_touch).**
- `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/signal_weights/**` — sealed at S5.
- `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/LL*.md` — all sealed at S2/S3/S4/S5.
- `06_LEARNING_LAYER/OBSERVATIONS/**` — read-only.
- `01_FACTS_LAYER/**` — L1 frozen.
- `025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/**` — L2.5 frozen.
- `.geminirules` / `.gemini/project_state.md` — mirror sync deferred to M4-C-S1.
- `platform/**` — out of M4-B-S6 scope (W2-UQE-ACTIVATE platform workstream uses on-disk brief).

**ND.** No open native directives. ND.1 (Mirror Discipline) addressed since Step 7 close.

**NAP impact.** NAP.M4.5 (LL.1 pass_2 spot-check) RESOLVED at S5 (30/30 approved). NAP.M4.6 (LL.7 discovery prior rubric) PENDING_NATIVE_DECISION — brief authored at M4-B-P5 (`NAP_M4_6_BRIEF_v1_0.md` v1.0); fires at M4-C-S3 entry per `PHASE_M4C_PLAN §6`; not gating M4-C-S1 entry. NAP.M4.7 (M4 macro-phase close) scheduled at M4-D close.

**Next session.** **M4-C-S1** — LL.5 dasha-transit synergy first shadow-mode write. M4-C entry-gate per `PHASE_M4_PLAN §3.3` cleared (LL.1 weights stable + N-threshold met both satisfied at full PASS). M4-C-S1 brief authoring should consume `PHASE_M4C_PLAN_v1_0.md` v1.0 DRAFT (authored at M4-B-P5) for sub-phase plan + carry-forward roster + parallel-slot opportunities. M4-C-S1 must (a) re-run MP.1+MP.2 mirror sync as first substantive action (F.RT.S6.M.1 carry-forward); (b) re-attempt Gemini reachability per R.LL1TPA.1 carry-forward; (c) consume LL.3 §5.1 R.LL3.1/R.LL3.2/R.LL3.3 fix-before-prod recommendations.

*(Below: retained narrative from prior session close M4-B-P1-GAP-TRAVEL-CLOSE for audit trail.)*

At the close of **M4-B-P1-GAP-TRAVEL-CLOSE (2026-05-02) — GAP.M4A.04 STATUS FLIP + B.10 FULL-CLOSE ATTEMPT AUDIT (parallel to M4-B-S3)**:

**Sub-phase.** M4-B IN PROGRESS. This is a **parallel-slot governance-aside session** running alongside M4-B-S3 (LL.2 shadow writes). P1 and S3 are scope-disjoint by brief design (P1 owns LEL_GAP_AUDIT + CURRENT_STATE + SESSION_LOG; S3 owns SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION + CALIBRATION_RUBRIC + CURRENT_STATE + SESSION_LOG). The one cross-cutting surface is CURRENT_STATE — handled per brief AC.P1.5 by version-skip convention (P1 → v1.8; S3 → v1.7 reserved).

**GAP.M4A.04 status flip.** The §5.4 NAP.M4.2 patch action — promote `EVT.2019.05.XX.01` (US move) and `EVT.2023.05.XX.01` (India return) from `category: residential` to joint `category: residential+travel` — was discharged on the L1 side at session `M4-A-CLOSE-LEL-PATCH` (2026-05-02) when LEL bumped v1.5 → v1.6. Per the §5.4 status-flip protocol, this session flips **GAP.M4A.04 status `deferred-pending-patch` → `partially_closed`** in `06_LEARNING_LAYER/OBSERVATIONS/LEL_GAP_AUDIT_v1_0.md` and bumps the audit v1.1 → v1.2. The travel-category cell value moves from 1 to 3 across the §3.3 corpus matrix; foreign-land signal stack (CVG.03, SIG.MSR.004, SIG.MSR.005) now has three anchor events for M4-B calibration rather than one.

**B.10 full-close attempt — audit and verdict.** The P1 brief asked for a "Full Close" of GAP.M4A.04 if B.10-compliant source data exists. Two candidate sources were examined and ruled negative:

(1) `01_FACTS_LAYER/FORENSIC_ASTROLOGICAL_DATA_v8_0.md §life_events` does not exist. FORENSIC v8.0 is a chart-data file by `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_2.md §C.1` design (§0–§27 cover natal chart, divisionals, KP, dasha systems, strength metrics, Ashtakavarga, sensitive points, lagnas, sahams, arudhas, Navatara, Panchang, aspects, Chalit, Chandra, Kota, deities, Sade Sati, Varshphal, cross-references, longevity, JH-engine dashas, yogas, completeness ledger). Life events live at `01_FACTS_LAYER/LIFE_EVENT_LOG_v1_2.md` — a different L1 artifact.

(2) LEL §6 gap register entry `GAP.TRAVEL_MISC.01` names "possibly multiple Russia-related business trips for Marsys exports" as the only travel residual — explicitly speculative ("possibly multiple"; no dates; no destinations confirmed). Promoting this string to dated `EVT.YYYY.MM.DD.XX` entries would require date and/or destination fabrication, a B.10 violation. LEL §4 chronic patterns + §5 inner-turning-point periods + §7 retrodictive summary all surveyed; no further B.10-compliant promotion candidate surfaces beyond what §3 event log already carries.

**Verdict.** No source data exists to advance GAP.M4A.04 beyond `partially_closed` without violating B.10 ("No fabricated computation"). NAP.M4.2 §5.4 explicitly closed the only B.10-compliant alternative path (native elicitation): "No further elicitation required for GAP.M4A.04 at this time." **Outcome: PARTIAL_CLOSE** per AC.P1.4 alternative path. LEL stays at v1.6 — no new events; no v1.7 bump; AC.P1.3 N/A under this outcome. Residual (international business travel, pilgrimages, return visits during US years) carries forward as `deferred` per NAP.M4.2; future closure gated on native re-decision.

**Files changed (within may_touch only).**
- `06_LEARNING_LAYER/OBSERVATIONS/LEL_GAP_AUDIT_v1_0.md` — MODIFIED (v1.1 → v1.2; frontmatter rotated; §5.5 added with post-patch flip + B.10 audit narrative; §5.6 final disposition tally; §8 v1.2 changelog).
- `00_ARCHITECTURE/CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md` — MODIFIED (v1.6 → v1.8; §2 freshness fields rotated; §2 parallel_session_notes block added; §3 narrative top entry replaced; predecessor M4-B-S2 narrative preserved; v1.7 changelog line RESERVED for parallel S3; v1.8 changelog appended).
- `00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_LOG.md` — MODIFIED (this entry appended).

**Out-of-scope, deliberately not touched (per brief must_not_touch).**
- `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/**` — live M4-B-S3 scope.
- `025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/**` — L2.5 frozen.
- `00_ARCHITECTURE/CALIBRATION_RUBRIC_v1_0.md` — KR.M4A.CLOSE.1 still carries to S3.
- `platform/**` — out of P1 scope.
- `01_FACTS_LAYER/LIFE_EVENT_LOG_v1_2.md` — was on may_touch but **not modified** (no B.10-compliant events to add; LEL v1.6 stands).

**Red-team.** No red-team this session. Governance-aside class — small status flip + audit refresh; no engine, no retrieval, no synthesis, no calibration weights. Per `ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G`, governance asides do not increment the IS.8(a) every-third-session counter. Counter unchanged at 1.

**ND.** No open native directives. ND.1 (Mirror Discipline) addressed since Step 7 close.

**Mirror sync (MP.1/MP.2).** Not propagated this session — small governance-aside scope; deferred to next substantive close that already touches `.geminirules` / `.gemini/project_state.md`. Any DIS.class.mirror_desync window opened by M4-B-S3 (if S3 is substantive and runs without same-session mirror update) is independent of P1.

**NAP impact.** NAP.M4.2 §5.4 patch action now **fully discharged at the LEL_GAP_AUDIT level** (GAP.M4A.04 status reflected as `partially_closed`; LEL v1.6 patch already discharged the L1 side at M4-A-CLOSE-LEL-PATCH). NAP.M4.2 itself remains a permanent record; no new NAP opens.

**Next session.** `M4-B-S3` (parallel sibling) — LL.2 graph edge weight modulators (shadow-mode) gated on LL.1 stability per `SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §3.5`, plus the `KR.M4A.CLOSE.1` CALIBRATION_RUBRIC frontmatter flip. After S3 closes, the parallel_session_notes block in §2 of this file should be removed at the next steady-state close.

*(Below: retained narrative from prior session close M4-B-S2-MIRROR-TWOPASS for audit trail.)*

At the close of **M4-B-S2-MIRROR-TWOPASS (2026-05-02) — MIRROR SYNC + LL.1 TWO-PASS APPROVAL PASS_1**:

**Sub-phase.** **M4-B IN PROGRESS.** S1 already done at M4-B-S1-LL1-SHADOW-WEIGHTS (2026-05-02 — 380 signals observed; 30 promotion-eligible pending two-pass; no production weight written; documented procedural irregularity that S1 ran ahead of M4-A formal close as single-track all-domain rather than planned B1/B2 split — KR.M4A.CLOSE.2). S2 (this session) discharges (a) the MP.1+MP.2 mirror-sync carry-forward declared at M4-A close — `.geminirules` + `.gemini/project_state.md` updated to adapted parity reflecting M4-A CLOSED + M4-B-S1 done + M4-B-S2 in flight; and (b) §3(c) two-pass approval pass_1 for the 30 promotion-eligible LL.1 signals, performed by Claude-surrogate-M4-B-S2 acting as a flagged stand-in for Gemini (Gemini unavailable synchronously per `MACRO_PLAN §Multi-Agent`).

**Two-pass approval pass_1.** All 30 promotion-eligible signals reviewed against the §3 promotion criteria (re-derived by direct read of the shadow file — no fabricated computation per B.10) plus the M4-B-S2 brief's hard-constraint demotion rule (mean<0.4 OR variance>0.3 → shadow_indefinite, not triggered for any of the 30). **30 approved / 0 held / 0 demoted.** 3 signals (SIG.MSR.118, .119, .143 — Tier-C borderline, mean=0.4545 var=0.2727 N=11, identical descriptive statistics across three IDs) explicitly flagged for closer NAP.M4.5 (pass_2) native scrutiny: independent phenomena vs one phenomenon counted three times. Document: `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/LL1_TWO_PASS_APPROVAL_v1_0.md` v1.0 (§1 methodology + §2 30-signal table + §3 surrogate red-team + §4 decisions + §5 approval_chain + §6 5 known residuals + §7 changelog).

**Shadow file patched.** `signal_weights/shadow/ll1_shadow_weights_v1_0.json` `approval_chain` field populated for all 30 promotion-eligible signals (pass_1_reviewer = Claude-surrogate-M4-B-S2; pass_1_date = 2026-05-02; pass_1_decision = "approved"; per-signal pass_1_notes; pass_2_status = "pending"; pass_2_nap_id = "NAP.M4.5"). The 350 non-eligible signals (insufficient_observations / shadow_indefinite_low_match_rate / shadow_indefinite_high_variance) untouched.

**Production-pending file created.** `signal_weights/production/ll1_weights_promoted_v1_0.json` written carrying the 30 pass_1-approved signals with `status: "production_pending_pass_2"`, `weights_in_production_register: false`, `pass_2_status: "pending_NAP.M4.5"`, `weights_block_reason` field naming the §3.1(c)+(d) gates as the reason no downstream pipeline operation may consume these weights yet. Schema mirrors the shadow file entry shape per AC.S2.5; n=1 disclaimer carried verbatim per `SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §7`.

**Held-out partition discipline.** The 9 held-out LEL events remain untouched; `lel_event_match_records.json` was not modified by this session. Sampling-verified at §3.4 of LL1_TWO_PASS_APPROVAL_v1_0.md: none of the 30 records' observation lists contain any held-out event ID.

**Mirror sync MP.1 + MP.2.** Discharged this session — both `.geminirules` (footer + state-line additions for M4-A CLOSED, M4-B-S1 done, M4-B-S2 in flight) and `.gemini/project_state.md` (top state block refreshed) updated to adapted parity in same session per ND.1. The carry-forward flagged at M4-A-CLOSE-LEL-PATCH is now CLOSED; no `DIS.class.mirror_desync` candidate opens. `mirror_enforcer.py` not run at this close (substrate session; carries to next substantive close).

**Red-team.** No red-team this session. M4-B-S2 is a substrate session, not a sub-phase or macro-phase close; IS.8(a) every-third counter increments 0→1; next cadence-fires at counter=3 (two substantive sessions hence — likely M4-B-S3 then S4).

**ND.** No open native directives. ND.1 (Mirror Discipline) addressed since Step 7 close; reaffirmed by the same-session MP.1+MP.2 propagation this session.

**Session.** Substantive learning-layer + governance session per `ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G` (substantive — counter increments). Strict scope respected: did NOT touch `01_FACTS_LAYER/**`, `025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/**`, `06_LEARNING_LAYER/OBSERVATIONS/**`, `00_ARCHITECTURE/MACRO_PLAN_v2_0.md`, `00_ARCHITECTURE/PHASE_B_PLAN_v1_0.md`, `00_ARCHITECTURE/GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL_v1_0.md`, `platform/**`. Read-only access to SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL_v1_0.md + lel_event_match_records.json metadata (held-out event IDs only) for surrogate red-team verification at §3.4 of LL1_TWO_PASS_APPROVAL.

**Next session.** `M4-B-S3` — LL.2 graph edge weight modulators (shadow-mode) gated on LL.1 stability per `SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §3.5`, plus the `KR.M4A.CLOSE.1` CALIBRATION_RUBRIC frontmatter flip. Cowork thread proposal: `M4-B-S3 — LL.2 Shadow Writes (gated on LL.1 stability)`.

*(Below: retained narrative from prior session close M4-A-CLOSE-LEL-PATCH for audit trail.)*

At the close of **M4-A-CLOSE-LEL-PATCH (2026-05-02) — M4-A SUB-PHASE FORMALLY CLOSED**:

**Sub-phase.** **M4-A CLOSED.** Sealing artifact: `00_ARCHITECTURE/M4_A_CLOSE_v1_0.md` v1.0 (8 sections per M3_CLOSE template). All 10 acceptance criteria from `PHASE_M4_PLAN_v1_0.md §3.1` (AC.M4A.1 through AC.M4A.10) verified PASS against committed artifacts on `post-merge-main`. Single carry-forward at the documentation layer: `KR.M4A.CLOSE.1` — `CALIBRATION_RUBRIC_v1_0.md` frontmatter still reads `status: AWAITING_NATIVE_APPROVAL`, `version: 1.0-DRAFT` despite NAP.M4.1 APPROVED at M4-A-INTEGRATION-PASS-R3 per CURRENT_STATE v1.3. Semantic approval is intact — every event-match record cites `rubric_option: B` — and the frontmatter flip is scheduled at M4-B Round 1 entry (not blocking).

**LEL v1.6 patch.** GAP.M4A.04 (travel sparsity) partial close per NAP.M4.2 native disposition. Two events dual-tagged: `EVT.2019.05.XX.01` (US move May 2019) and `EVT.2023.05.XX.01` (India return May 2023) now carry `category: residential+travel` with subcategory cross-reference (`foreign_move_start` / `foreign_return` annotated `dual-tagged residential+travel per GAP.M4A.04 partial close, LEL v1.6`). LEL frontmatter `version: 1.5 → 1.6`; changelog appended. Total events unchanged at 46 (both targets already existed in v1.3+ corpus; chart_state blocks already populated by v1.4 Swiss Ephemeris pass — no recomputation required). Remaining GAP.M4A.04 (travel-decade sparsity below the §5.2 threshold of LEL_GAP_AUDIT v1.1) carries forward as accept/defer at native discretion.

**Mirror sync (MP.1 + MP.2) — carry-forward.** `.geminirules` (MP.1) and `.gemini/project_state.md` (MP.2) Gemini-side adapted-parity propagation is OUTSIDE this session's `may_touch` scope (the close brief restricted to four files: M4_A_CLOSE, LEL, CURRENT_STATE, SESSION_LOG). The propagation is **flagged as a carry-forward**: the next session that opens declares `.geminirules` + `.gemini/project_state.md` in its `may_touch` and updates them to adapted parity reflecting M4-A CLOSED + M4-B in-flight. Per `GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL §K.3 step 3`, if the carry-forward is not picked up by the immediately-following session, a `DIS.class.mirror_desync` candidate entry opens in `DISAGREEMENT_REGISTER_v1_0.md`. `mirror_enforcer.py` was not run at this close.

**M4-B already partially executed — procedural irregularity.** M4-B-S1-LL1-SHADOW-WEIGHTS ran AHEAD of this M4-A formal close at commit 550fa77 (hash-stamp follow-up efa599c). On-disk evidence at HEAD: `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/signal_weights/shadow/ll1_shadow_weights_v1_0.json` exists (225,178 bytes; 380 signals observed; 30 promotion_eligible_pending_two_pass; 285 insufficient_observations; 52 shadow_indefinite_low_match_rate; 13 shadow_indefinite_high_variance; 37 training events used; 9 held-out events excluded). Implementation deviated from `PHASE_M4_PLAN §3.2` planned B1/B2 parallel split — ran as single-track all-domain shadow-write. **No production weight promoted** (production register `signal_weights/production/` does not exist; the 30 promotion-eligible signals remain blocked at §3(c) two-pass approval gate + §3(d) native-notification gate). Held-out partition discipline (Learning Layer rule #4) was respected. M4_A_CLOSE §8 + §3 item 0 (KR.M4A.CLOSE.2) document the irregularity for audit. Damage assessment: procedural-only; no calibration corruption; carry-forward at M4-B-S2 for native review (accept-as-is or schedule B1/B2 re-split).

**Red-team.** No red-team this session (M4-A close is sub-phase close, not macro-phase close; IS.8(b) fires at M4-D close). IS.8(a) every-third-session counter at 0 entering M4-B; next cadence-fires at counter=3 (three substantive M4-B sessions hence). The IS.8(a) discharge for the M4-A Round-2/Round-3 cycle was REDTEAM_M4A_v1_0.md PASS 6/6 axes at M4-A-S2-T1-REDTEAM-BATCH1 (commit 79a6810).

**ND.** No open native directives at M4-A close. ND.1 (Mirror Discipline) addressed since Step 7 close.

**Session.** Governance / sub-phase-close session per `ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G` — sealing-artifact authoring + L1 minor-version patch (NAP-execution writeback) + state-pointer updates + SESSION_LOG append. Strict scope respected: did NOT touch `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/` (M4-B scope; T2 owns), `06_LEARNING_LAYER/OBSERVATIONS/` (already committed; not modified this session), `025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/`, `035_DISCOVERY_LAYER/`, `platform/`. Read-only access to MSR / FORENSIC / committed M4-A artifacts for AC verification only.

**Next session.** `M4-B-S2` — two-pass approval (§3(c) Gemini red-team review on the 30 promotion-eligible signals) + native notification (§3(d)) + native review of M4-B-S1 single-track implementation vs planned B1/B2 split + KR.M4A.CLOSE.1 (CALIBRATION_RUBRIC frontmatter flip) + MP.1+MP.2 mirror sync carry-forward + LL.2 / LL.3 / LL.4 mechanism activation per `PHASE_M4_PLAN §3.2`. Cowork thread proposal: `M4-B-S2 — Two-Pass Approval + Single-Track Reconciliation`.

*(Below: retained narrative from prior session close M3-W4-D2-M3-CLOSE for audit trail.)*

At the close of **M3-W4-D2-M3-CLOSE (2026-05-01) — M3 MACRO-PHASE CLOSED**:

**Macro-phase.** **M3 CLOSED. M4 — Calibration + LEL Ground-Truth Spine — is now ACTIVE.** Sealing artifact: `00_ARCHITECTURE/M3_CLOSE_v1_0.md`. M3→M4 handoff memo: `00_ARCHITECTURE/HANDOFF_M3_TO_M4_v1_0.md`. M3 IS.8(b) macro-phase-close red-team verdict (discharged at M3-W4-D1): PASS 9/9 axes; 0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH / 0 MEDIUM / 1 LOW (KR.M3.RT.LOW.1 carry-forward to M4). M3 phase plan (`PHASE_M3_PLAN_v1_0.md` v1.0) now SUPERSEDED-AS-COMPLETE. M4 phase plan TBD — first M4 session decides whether to author `PHASE_M4_PLAN_v1_0.md` or drive M4 directly from `MACRO_PLAN_v2_0.md §M4` (native-approval point at M4 open per `PHASE_M3_PLAN §5`).

**Deliverables (Gate 4 of M3-D per session brief).** Four artifacts produced this session:

(1) **`M3_CLOSE_v1_0.md`** — sealing artifact. §1 quality bar: 27 PASS / 1 DEFERRED (AC.M3A.5 native-accepted; M4-class) / 1 PASS+DEFERRED-PARTIAL (AC.M3D.3 external acharya M4-class) / 0 FAIL across all M3 acceptance criteria (AC.M3A.1..9 + AC.M3B.1..7 + AC.M3C.1..6 + AC.M3D.1..7). §2 wave log: W1 (M3-OPEN + M3-A 5 sessions) + W2 (M3-B 2 sessions) + W3 (M3-C 3 sessions) + W4 (M3-D 3 sessions including M3-PRE-D-GOVERNANCE + D1 + D2). §3 deferred items: 13 enumerated across "inherited from M3 sub-phases" (KR.M3.RT.LOW.1, KR.M3A.JH-EXPORT, DIS.010/011/012-N3, Sthana+Drik ECR, Narayana ECR, KR.M3A2.1, three Shadbala convention findings, AC.M3A.5, R.M3D.1 external acharya) and "inherited from M2" (SIG.MSR.207 absent from MSR; UCN inline citation aspirational; TS test-fixture errors; KR.W9.1+W9.2 auth-wall). §4 red-team evidence: REDTEAM_M3 PASS 9/9; counter trail in M3 detailed (M2-CLOSE→0; B1→1; C1→2; B2→3; C2 held; A2 IS.8(a) FIRES reset 3→0; A3→1; C3→2; A4→IS.8(a) FIRES reset 3→0; PRE-D held 0; D1→1 IS.8(b) DISCHARGED; D2→2 close). §5 ND status: open=[]; addressed=[ND.1]. §6 mirror sync evidence: MP.1+MP.2 same-session. §7 live platform state. §8 M3 exit confirmed.

(2) **`HANDOFF_M3_TO_M4_v1_0.md`** — handoff memo. What M3 delivered (capability inventory across A/B/C/D — Discovery Engine query-time activation; Vimshottari + Yogini + Transit + signal_activator; Chara + Narayana needs_verification; KP per-natal-planet snapshot; Varshaphala 78 charts; Shadbala 4-of-6 deterministic with Sthana+Drik ECR; Validator + Held-Out Sample + REDTEAM_M3; DIS register hygiene). Live platform state at M3 close (22 retrieval tools; 5 M3 temporal tables; CAPABILITY_MANIFEST 112 entries; 4 DISCOVERY_*_ENABLED flags default-true). What M4 needs to know (LEL ground-truth spine; per-signal calibration weights; LL.1-LL.4 STUB→active; held-out cohort discipline; JH integration scope decision). HARD PREREQUISITES for M4: **LEL ≥40 events spanning ≥5 years** (current 35 events; **5-event gap**; native owns gate-clearance; span 1984-2025 = 41 years already exceeds 5-year minimum). Inherited open items by owner (native | next-session | M9-class | Portal R-stream). Active feature flags. Active disagreements (DIS.009 resolved-R3-pending-ECR; DIS.010/011/012 resolved-N3). Concurrent workstreams. Operational checklist for M4 (16 inheritance items).

(3) **CURRENT_STATE flip** — this file. `active_macro_phase: M3 → M4`; `active_macro_phase_title: "Calibration + LEL Ground-Truth Spine"`; `active_phase_plan: null` (M4 phase plan authoring decision deferred to first M4 session); `last_session_id: M3-W4-D2-M3-CLOSE`; `red_team_counter: 1 → 2` (D2 substantive); `next_session_objective: M4-W1-OPEN (or PHASE_M4_PLAN_v1_0.md)`; §3 narrative refreshed with M3-W4-D2 close at top; changelog entry added.

(4) **Mirror sync MP.1 + MP.2.** `.geminirules` updated to reflect `active_macro_phase` M3 → M4 + `last_session_id` → M3-W4-D2-M3-CLOSE + `next_session_objective` at adapted parity (footer line + §F state block). `.gemini/project_state.md` updated to reflect M3 macro-phase CLOSED + M4 active + handoff memo pointer + LEL minimum-volume entry-gate at adapted parity. `mirror_enforcer.py` exit 0 required at this close (per AC.M3D.6).

**Counter trail (post-close).** D2 substantive: counter 1→2. Next IS.8(a) every-third cadence at counter=3 (one substantive session hence — likely first M4 session). Next IS.8(b) macro-phase-close cadence at M4 close.

**Scope compliance.** Strict respect of must_not_touch: did NOT touch `01_FACTS_LAYER/**`, `025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/**`, `035_DISCOVERY_LAYER/**`, `05_TEMPORAL_ENGINES/**`, `platform/src/**`, `platform/migrations/**`, `PHASE_M3_PLAN_v1_0.md` (now SUPERSEDED-AS-COMPLETE; not modified at this close), `DISAGREEMENT_REGISTER_v1_0.md` (read-only), `00_ARCHITECTURE/EVAL/**` (D1 deliverables frozen post-commit ad4a6d2). L1 frozen.

**Next session.** M4-W1-OPEN (first M4 session; new Cowork thread). Native-approval points at M4 open: (a) author `PHASE_M4_PLAN_v1_0.md` or drive M4 directly from `MACRO_PLAN §M4`; (b) LEL gate-clearance plan; (c) JH integration scope. Hard prerequisite: LEL ≥40 events ≥5 years span before M4-A calibration substrate work begins. Pre-gate work (M4 phase plan authoring; LL.1 STUB-banner-removal preparation) is not gate-blocked.

*(Below: retained narrative from prior session close M3-W4-D1-VALIDATOR-REDTEAM for audit trail.)*

At the close of **M3-W4-D1-VALIDATOR-REDTEAM (2026-05-01) — M3-D Wave 4 first execution session CLOSED**:

**Macro-phase.** M3 — Temporal Animation / Discovery Layer, active. M3-D D1 closed; D2 (M3-W4-D2-M3-CLOSE, same Cowork thread) authors the M3 sealing artifacts. M3-A (M3-W1-A4) and M3-C (M3-W3-C3) are CLOSED; M3-B Track 2 (B1 + B2) closed with B3 antardasha cross-check optional or close en bloc at M3-D — closed en bloc at this D1 by virtue of the antardasha-aware validator (TEST-V.1 PD-chain contiguity assertion across all 567 PD rows) + held-out date sample (10 dates each carrying the AD column). DIS.010/011/012 RESOLVED-N3 at M3-PRE-D-GOVERNANCE-2026-05-01 (defer to M9 multi-school triangulation per PHASE_M3_PLAN §8 default policy).

**Gate 1 — Temporal validator meta-tests.** `00_ARCHITECTURE/EVAL/TEMPORAL/run_validator.py` authored implementing six deterministic invariants over the M3-B/C JSON outputs + DIS register: TEST-V.1 Vimshottari completeness (7 MD + 63 AD + 567 PD contiguous; span 1984-02-05 → 2070-08-18); TEST-V.2 Yogini continuity (8-lord cycle, Bhramari first); TEST-V.3 Transit determinism + lit/dormant/ripening presence; TEST-V.4 KP per-planet snapshot coverage; TEST-V.5 Shadbala planet coverage + FORENSIC anchors (Saturn Uccha 59.18 ±0.02 + Sun 33.99 ±0.02); TEST-V.6 cross-school disagreement boundary (no open `DIS.class.school_disagreement`). Run record: 6/6 PASS, exit 0. AC.M3D.1 PASS. `00_ARCHITECTURE/EVAL/TEMPORAL/VALIDATOR_META_TESTS_v1_0.md` documents the suite + a transparent adaptation note: TEST-V.4 was adapted from the brief's literal 0°-360° boundary-table expectation to the actual M3-W3-C2 per-planet snapshot shape. The adaptation honors B.10 (no fabrication of an asserted-but-absent shape) and B.3 (cite the actual design choice). Logged as KR.M3.RT.LOW.1 forward-work item in REDTEAM_M3 §6 + HANDOFF.

**Gate 2 — Held-out date sample.** `00_ARCHITECTURE/EVAL/M3_HELD_OUT_SAMPLE_v1_0.md` authored with 10 dates stratified per brief: 3 LEL events from different decades (1998-02-16 first job; 2008-06-09 Cognizant exit; 2018-11-28 father's death) + 3 non-landmark (2002-09-15; 2014-03-20; 2020-08-10) + 2 future (2026-08-15; 2027-09-12) + 2 dasha-transition (2010-09-05 +18d after Saturn→Mercury MD; 1985-01-25 -12d before Jupiter-Jupiter→Jupiter-Saturn AD). Each row carries (a) Vimshottari MD/AD via JSON; (b) Yogini MD via JSON; (c) KP Asc + sublord computed via pyswisseph at native birth time-of-day; (d) top-3 lit signals via signal_activator.py with MD-lord-anchored ranking; (e) in-session native verdict. Result: **CONSISTENT 10/10**. AC.M3D.2 + AC.M3D.3 PASS (in-session native review; external acharya review M4-class per R.M3D.1). The two future-dated rows (2026-08-15 + 2027-09-12) logged to LEL §9 PROSPECTIVE PREDICTION SUBSECTION (newly added by this session — append-only) per CLAUDE.md §E concurrent-workstream rule (PPL substrate; outcome=null until observed). PRED.M3D.HOLDOUT.001 + PRED.M3D.HOLDOUT.002 each carry confidence + horizon + falsifier per Learning Layer #4.

**Gate 3 — IS.8(b) macro-phase-close red-team.** `00_ARCHITECTURE/EVAL/REDTEAM_M3_v1_0.md` authored as the M3 macro-phase-close red-team per `MACRO_PLAN §IS.8(b)` + `PHASE_M3_PLAN §3.4 AC.M3D.4`. Nine adversarial axes per session brief: RT.M3.1 B.1 layer-separation across all M3 sub-phases (L1 frozen except §E-sanctioned PPL append; CONTRADICTION_FRAMING preserves discipline); RT.M3.2 B.3 derivation-ledger discipline (12 spot-checks across PAT/CON/SHADBALA-CROSSCHECK/VIMSHOTTARI-CROSSCHECK — all CITED); RT.M3.3 B.10 no-fabricated-computation (7 Shadbala components + Vimshottari boundaries + KP degrees traced; Sthana+Drik ECR-tagged); RT.M3.4 DIS register completeness (DIS.001..012 all resolved); RT.M3.5 temporal validator integrity (6/6 PASS; sufficiency); RT.M3.6 feature-flag hygiene (DISCOVERY_PATTERN_ENABLED + DISCOVERY_CONTRADICTION_ENABLED default-true; no temporal-engine flag required); RT.M3.7 ECR completeness (PAT.008b + Sthana + Drik + Narayana ECR specs all (i)-(iv) compliant); RT.M3.8 PPL substrate (LEL §9 active; held-out future predictions logged); RT.M3.9 acharya-grade quality bar (3/3 cold reads above-or-at acharya-on-first-pass per CLAUDE.md §J). **Verdict PASS 9/9 axes; 0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH / 0 MEDIUM / 1 LOW (KR.M3.RT.LOW.1).** 0 fixes applied. M3 close gate CLEARED. AC.M3D.4 PASS.

**Counter trail in M3 (per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G).** Reset to 0 at M3-W1-A4 close (IS.8(a) FIRED → reset 3→0). M3-PRE-D-GOVERNANCE governance-aside did NOT increment. M3-W4-D1 (this session) substantive: 0→1; IS.8(b) macro-phase-close cadence DISCHARGED but does NOT reset the every-third counter (only IS.8(a) fires reset). Counter stands at 1 post-discharge. Next IS.8(a) every-third cadence fires at counter=3 (two substantive sessions hence — likely first or second M4 session).

**Scope compliance.** Strict respect of must_not_touch: did NOT touch `platform/src/**`, `01_FACTS_LAYER/FORENSIC_ASTROLOGICAL_DATA_v8_0.md`, `025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/**`, `035_DISCOVERY_LAYER/**`, `05_TEMPORAL_ENGINES/**` (read-only validator input only), `platform/migrations/**`, `PHASE_M3_PLAN_v1_0.md`, `DISAGREEMENT_REGISTER_v1_0.md` (read-only). LEL §9 append-only authorized by CLAUDE.md §E + brief's may_touch declaration. L1 frozen except for §9 PPL append.

**Next session.** M3-W4-D2-M3-CLOSE (same Cowork thread M3-W4-D1-VALIDATOR-REDTEAM as successor). Predecessor = M3-W4-D1-VALIDATOR-REDTEAM. Scope: M3_CLOSE_v1_0.md + HANDOFF_M3_TO_M4_v1_0.md + flip CURRENT_STATE active_macro_phase M3 → M4 + sync MP.1 (.geminirules) + MP.2 (.gemini/project_state.md) to adapted parity. mirror_enforcer.py exit 0 required.

*(Below: retained narrative from prior session close M3-W1-A4-DIS009-DISPOSITION for audit trail.)*

At the close of **M3-W1-A4-DIS009-DISPOSITION (2026-05-01) — Track 1 (Discovery Engine + DIS.009 Disposition) fourth execution session CLOSED AND M3-A SUB-PHASE CLOSED**:

**Macro-phase.** M3 — Temporal Animation / Discovery Layer, active. PHASE_M3_PLAN_v1_0.md v1.0 active. **M3-A is now CLOSED.** Track 1 substrate complete: A1 (eval baseline + DIS.009 written analysis) + A2 (4 DISCOVERY_*_ENABLED flag-gating + manifest entry_count fix + REDTEAM_M3A IS.8(a) cadence-fire) + A3 (synthesis-prompt CONTRADICTION_FRAMING amendment) + A4 (this session — DIS.009 R3 disposition + REDTEAM_M3A2 IS.8(a) cadence-fire + M3-A close-checklist). M3-C is also CLOSED (M3-W3-C3-SHADBALA, 2026-05-01). M3-B in flight (Track 2: B1 + B2 closed; B3 antardasha cross-check pending or close en bloc at M3-D per PHASE_M3_PLAN §3.2). M3-D macro-phase-close cadence (§IS.8(b)) remains scheduled per PHASE_M3_PLAN §3.4 AC.M3D.4.

**Gate 1 — DIS.009 R3 disposition.** Native verdict: R3 (RE-GROUND). PAT.008 mechanism rewritten in-place to make the two-step architecture explicit per native-specified rewrite direction. **STEP 1 (direct, L1-clean):** Arudha Lagna = Capricorn 10H (FORENSIC §17, derivation Lagna Aries → lord Mars in 7th Libra → 10th from Libra = Capricorn). Capricorn lord = Saturn (classical rulership). Therefore Saturn governs the AL surface directly. **STEP 2 (one-step-removed, via dispositorship):** Atmakaraka = Moon (highest D1 longitude 27°02′); Moon's D9 sign = Gemini (FORENSIC §3.5 D9.MOON); Karakamsa = Gemini, ruled by Mercury (not Saturn). Mercury occupies Capricorn 10H Vargottama (D1 Capricorn at FORENSIC §1 line 160; D9 Capricorn at §3.5 line 285 with Vargottama=YES). Saturn DISPOSITS Mercury, Mercury rules the D9 Karakamsa. The Saturn-Mercury identity axis runs across the Capricorn-Gemini spine. The original "Saturn governs both surfaces" framing was literally false against L1 (Karakamsa lord = Mercury, not Saturn); the rewrite preserves the identity-lock framing per native instruction while correcting the mechanism to its true two-step shape. `[EXTERNAL_COMPUTATION_REQUIRED]` block added per CLAUDE.md §I B.10 with native-specified JH D9 export spec (verify Moon D9 = Gemini + Mercury D1 = Capricorn). PAT.008 status: `needs_verification`; `re_validation_status` flipped `gemini_conflict → resolved_pending_ecr`. DIS.009 status: `open → resolved`; `resolution` prose authored; `resolved_on=2026-05-01`; `resolved_by_session=M3-W1-A4-DIS009-DISPOSITION`; `arbitration_steps_taken` extended with `reconciler_resolution` (A1 analysis) + `native_arbitration` (this session's R3 verdict). AC.M3A.4 PASS.

**Gate 2 — IS.8(a) every-third-session red-team.** REDTEAM_M3A2_v1_0.md authored as the second M3 IS.8(a) cadence-fire (first was REDTEAM_M3A_v1_0.md at A2 close). Counter trail in M3: 0 (M2-close reset) → 1 (B1) → 2 (C1) → 3 (B2) → 3 (C2 held) → A2 fires reset 3→0 → 1 (A3) → 2 (C3) → 3 (A4 fires reset 3→0). Seven axes per brief Gate 2: RT.M3A2.1 B.1 layer-separation, RT.M3A2.2 B.3 derivation-ledger, RT.M3A2.3 B.10 no-fabricated-computation, RT.M3A2.4 flag-gate correctness, RT.M3A2.5 DIS.009 disposition consistency (Gate 1 cross-check), RT.M3A2.6 eval baseline integrity, RT.M3A2.7 scope compliance. Verdict PASS 7/7 axes; 0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH / 0 MEDIUM / 1 LOW (KR.M3A2.1: PAT.008 ECR text could explicitly cite FORENSIC §3.5 as in-corpus L1 source for what JH is asked to verify — both Moon D9 = Gemini and Mercury D9 = Capricorn Vargottama are already L1-attested; native-instructed ECR text held verbatim per Gate 1 hard constraint; documentation-clarity carry-forward, not a B.10 violation). The IS.8(b) macro-phase-close red-team remains M3-D scope per AC.M3D.4. AC.M3A.9 PASS.

**Gate 3 — M3-A close-checklist.** 8 of 9 ACs PASS; AC.M3A.5 DEFERRED with rationale. AC.M3A.1 PASS (BASELINE_RUN_W9_MANUAL_v1_0.md non-stub, six metric rows populated in manual-capture mode per phase-plan entry-gate clause; numerical values await KR.W9.1 auth secrets; native-accepted at A1 close). AC.M3A.2 PASS (DISCOVERY_PATTERN_ENABLED default true post-A2 smoke; durable in feature_flags.ts:86). AC.M3A.3 PASS (DISCOVERY_CONTRADICTION_ENABLED default true post-A2 smoke; durable in feature_flags.ts:87). AC.M3A.4 PASS (Gate 1 R3 disposition). AC.M3A.5 DEFERRED — auth wall blocks both pre-baseline and post-baseline numerical capture; BASELINE_RUN_W9_MANUAL §6 native-acceptance scope authorized either (a) waiver with descriptive delta or (b) require secrets to land before M3-A close; native-accepted defer at this session close; target session = first M3-A-post / M3-D session with auth secrets. AC.M3A.6 PASS (chart_facts + FORENSIC remain mandatory floor; bundle composition layer is must_not_touch this session; verified via W6/W7 audit + read-only check). AC.M3A.7 PASS (PATTERN_REGISTER_JSON tool_binding=pattern_register + TOOL_QUERY_PATTERNS + CONTRADICTION_REGISTER_JSON tool_binding=contradiction_register + TOOL_QUERY_CONTRADICTIONS all present in CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.json; entry_count=112 = len(entries)). AC.M3A.8 PASS (CONTRADICTION_FRAMING preamble in shared.ts is instructional prose with explicit B.1+B.3 enforcement; covered by RT.M3A2.1). AC.M3A.9 PASS (Gate 2 REDTEAM_M3A2 PASS).

**Scope compliance.** Strict respect of must_not_touch: did NOT touch platform/src/lib/retrieve/**, platform/src/lib/synthesis/**, platform/src/lib/bundle/**, 01_FACTS_LAYER/**, 05_TEMPORAL_ENGINES/**, platform/migrations/**, 025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/**, PHASE_M3_PLAN_v1_0.md, CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.json (read-only verification of AC.M3A.7). L1 frozen. Read-only access to FORENSIC v8.0 §1 / §3.5 / §17 / §22 for cross-checking PAT.008 rewrite at Gate 1 and RT.M3A2.3 / RT.M3A2.5 axes; no L1 mutation.

**Carry-forward open items into M3-D.** (i) DIS.009 full closure pending JH D9 export per ED.1 (KR.M3A.JH-EXPORT, M3-B-class verification window). (ii) DIS.010/011/012 native verdicts on Jaimini multi-tradition forks (default N3 = defer to M9). (iii) Naisargika + Nathonnatha findings from Shadbala CROSSCHECK_v1_0.md §4/§5/§9. (iv) Sthana + Drik ECR resolution (Shadbala JH-export per ED.1). (v) KR.W9.1 + KR.W9.2 (eval-runner auth wall + parser quirk). (vi) KR.M3A2.1 (PAT.008 ECR clarification). (vii) Inherited from M2: SIG.MSR.207 absent from MSR_v3_0.md; UCN inline citation pass; TS test-fixture errors (Portal Redesign R-stream owns).

**Session.** Substantive governance-layer session per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G — counter 2→3 → §IS.8(a) FIRES → resets 3→0. Scripts at close: mirror_enforcer pre-close run exit=0 (8/8 pairs clean; claude_only=2); drift_detector + schema_validator at-close runs expected exit=2 carry-forward (touched files are governance-layer LIVING-not-fingerprint-locked artifacts; no canonical-artifact fingerprint rotation). All hard constraints from brief satisfied: native verdict obtained before Gate 1 execution; root path post-merge-main confirmed; single atomic git commit at session close per brief §"Hard Constraints" #3.

**Next session.** Native-choice between (a) M3-W2-B3-ANTARDASHA-CROSSCHECK (Track 2 standalone wrap-up; closes M3-B sub-phase ahead of M3-D) or (b) M3-W4-D1-VALIDATOR-REDTEAM (proceed directly to M3-D; close remaining Track 2 work en bloc per PHASE_M3_PLAN §3.2). Both M3-A and M3-C are now closed; Track 2 has only optional B3 remaining. M3-D scope per PHASE_M3_PLAN §3.4: temporal validator meta-tests + held-out date sample + 5 acharya-grade chart readings + IS.8(b) macro-phase-close red-team + M3_CLOSE + HANDOFF_M3_TO_M4 + CURRENT_STATE flip M3 → M4 + mirror sync.

*(Below: retained narrative from prior session close M3-W3-C3-SHADBALA for audit trail.)*

At the close of M3-W3-C3-SHADBALA (2026-05-01) — **Track 3 (M3-C Multi-school + KP + Varshaphala + Shadbala) third execution session CLOSED AND M3-C SUB-PHASE CLOSED**:

**Macro-phase.** M3 — Temporal Animation / Discovery Layer, active. PHASE_M3_PLAN_v1_0.md v1.0 active. **M3-C is now CLOSED.** Track 3 substrate complete: C1 (Jaimini Chara + Narayana — cross-check FAIL, both engine variants diverge from FORENSIC §5.3 K.N. Rao Padakrama by tradition-fork, GOLDEN gated; logged at C1 close pending native arbitration), C2 (KP sub-lord engine + Varshaphala Solar-Return engine + migrations 024/025 + 2 retrieval tools), C3 (this session — Shadbala over-time engine + migration 031 + REDTEAM_M3C sub-phase-close quality gate + DIS.010/011/012 opened on the Jaimini multi-tradition forks). M3-A in flight (Track 1: A1 baseline + A2 flag-gating + A3 synthesis-prompt amendment closed; A4 DIS.009 disposition pending → M3-A close-checklist follows). M3-B in flight (Track 2: B1 Vimshottari + B2 Yogini/Transit closed; optional B3 antardasha cross-check pending or close en bloc at M3-D per PHASE_M3_PLAN §3.2).

**Shadbala engine.** `compute_shadbala.py` runs pyswisseph 2.10.03 + Moshier ephemeris + Lahiri sidereal mode (no .se1 files required). Computes 4 of 6 Shadbala components deterministically — Uccha (exaltation/debilitation), Dig (Placidus angles + per-planet Dig point: Sun/Mars→MC, Moon/Venus→IC, Mercury/Jupiter→Asc, Saturn→Dsc), Naisargika (constant per planet per brief D1.c), Nathonnatha (Sun-altitude-anchored linear interpolation). Marks 2 of 6 as `[EXTERNAL_COMPUTATION_REQUIRED]` per CLAUDE.md §I B.10: Sthana Bala (requires JH Saptavargaja Bala export per ED.1) and Drik Bala (requires JH/Shri-Jyoti aspect-strength table per ED.1). Output: 63 rows over 9 snapshots × 7 planets. Snapshots = 7 Vimshottari MD start_dates (Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Ketu, Venus, Sun, Moon — from VIMSHOTTARI_RAW_v1_0.json M-level rows) + final MD end_date (2070-08-18) + today (2026-05-01). Time-of-day held at native birth time-of-day 10:43 IST per cross-check convention so the natal snapshot serves as the FORENSIC §6.1 anchor.

**Cross-check vs FORENSIC §6.1 (AC.M3C.4 anchors PASS).** All 7 planets' Uccha Bala match FORENSIC §6.1 SBL.UCHA within ±0.02 virupas. Brief explicit anchors: Saturn 59.19 (engine) vs 59.18 (FORENSIC) Δ+0.01 — well inside ±2 tolerance ✓; Sun 33.99 vs 33.99 Δ+0.00 ✓. All 7 planets' Dig Bala match FORENSIC §6.1 SBL.DIG.TOTAL within ±0.02 virupas. Verdict: WITHIN_TOLERANCE_PENDING_REVIEW per session-brief framing — three findings preserved for native review at M3-C close (NOT promoted to DIS register per Axis G of REDTEAM_M3C; these are brief-vs-classical fact-check decisions, not Vedic multi-school disagreements proper). The findings: (i) Naisargika brief values (Saturn=60..Sun=7.5 rupas) diverge from classical FORENSIC SBL.NAISARG.TOTAL (Sun=60..Saturn=8.58 virupas) — opposite-rank-order; (ii) Nathonnatha class assignment Saturn ↔ Venus swap — brief diurnal includes Saturn (classical: nocturnal); brief nocturnal includes Venus (classical: diurnal); engine emits brief classification → ±51.6 virupa swing on those two planets at the natal date; (iii) Nathonnatha altitude-linear methodology (per brief literal text "via pyswisseph Sun altitude") yields ±4.5 virupa drift on correctly-classified diurnals vs FORENSIC's apparent time-linear or ghati-from-sunrise formula.

**Migration 031 + DB pre-check.** Migration 031_shadbala.sql authored as next free index (022-030 occupied by W2/C2 deliverables); idempotent BEGIN/COMMIT-wrapped CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS shadbala + 2 indexes + 7 natal-snapshot INSERTs ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING. DB pre-check at session-open returned NULL for all four W2/C2 tables (`dasha_periods`, `signal_states`, `kp_sublords`, `varshaphala`) — migrations 022-025 also NOT applied to the live DB. Recorded as carry-forward for native action; engine work for D1 was self-contained per session-brief framing.

**REDTEAM_M3C sub-phase-close quality gate (NOT §IS.8(a) cadence).** REDTEAM_M3C_v1_0.md authored as PHASE_M3_PLAN §3.3 quality gate for M3-C close. 7 adversarial axes — A) B.1 layer-separation (FORENSIC L1 untouched; cross-check + DIS document divergence rather than mutate L1), B) B.3 derivation-ledger (every numerical claim cites pyswisseph signature or FORENSIC `SBL.<ID>`), C) B.10 no-fabricated-computation (Sthana + Drik schema-level ECR-tagged; partial_total documented as 4-of-6), D) ECR completeness (needs_verification=true row-level + actionable ECR specs), E) Jaimini boundary (no compute_chara/narayana invocation; read-only DIS-citation), F) migration idempotency (IF NOT EXISTS + ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING + BEGIN/COMMIT), G) school-disagreement close-scope (DIS.010/011/012 log without operator-preference resolution). All 7 axes PASS, 0 findings, 0 fixes applied. The §IS.8(a) every-third-session cadence already discharged at A2 close (REDTEAM_M3A_v1_0.md PASS, counter reset 3→0); §IS.8(b) macro-phase-close cadence remains scheduled for M3-D close per PHASE_M3_PLAN §3.4 AC.M3D.4. Counter at M3-W3-C3 close: 1→2.

**DIS register entries DIS.010/011/012 (Jaimini school_disagreement).** Three new DIS.class.school_disagreement entries appended to DISAGREEMENT_REGISTER_v1_0.md per PHASE_M3_PLAN §3.3 AC.M3C.5: DIS.010 (Chara Dasha sequence-start: Sanjay Rath / BPHS-Jaimini synthesis begins MD at AK sign vs K.N. Rao Padakrama begins at Lagna sign per FORENSIC §5.3); DIS.011 (Chara Dasha sign-duration rule: brief hardcoded constants vs BPHS sign-to-lord rule vs K.N. Rao Padakrama with additional rule overlay); DIS.012 (Narayana Dasha: no FORENSIC published Narayana table for this native, so external-acharya or JH-export verification required before treating engine output as settled). Each entry: status open, resolution pending_native_verdict, R1/R2/R3 options enumerated, default N3 per phase-plan policy (defer to M9 multi-school triangulation). Native arbitrates at M3-C close moment per AC.M3C.5; native may also choose N1 (adopt FORENSIC §5.3 K.N. Rao Padakrama as project-canonical Chara tradition) or N2 (adopt BPHS-Sanjay-Rath synthesis) or escalate to external acharya (DIS.012 N1).

**Jaimini boundary respected.** compute_chara.py and compute_narayana.py NOT invoked. 05_TEMPORAL_ENGINES/dasha/jaimini/** outputs (CHARA_RAW, NARAYANA_RAW) NOT used as computational input to compute_shadbala.py. Read-only access to 05_TEMPORAL_ENGINES/dasha/jaimini/CROSSCHECK_v1_0.md was used for D4 close-artifact authoring only (DIS.010/011/012 cite the FAIL verdict and N1/N2/N3 rationale text). Verified by Axis E of REDTEAM_M3C: `grep -n "chara\|narayana\|jaimini" compute_shadbala.py` = 0 matches.

**Multi-track close coordination.** This session is the seventh close of 2026-05-01 (chronologically: M3-W2-B1 → M3-W3-C1 → M3-W2-B2 → M3-W3-C2 → M3-W1-A2 → M3-W1-A3 → M3-W3-C3-SHADBALA). All Track 3 (M3-C) sessions are now closed; Track 1 (M3-A) has one open session (A4); Track 2 (M3-B) has zero open mandatory sessions (B3 optional or close at M3-D). Brief-declared predecessor M3-W3-C2-KP-VARSHAPHALA + chronological predecessor M3-W1-A3-CONTRADICTION-ENGINE both acknowledged at session-open handshake (predecessor_session + previous_session_id dual-pointer); §2 state-block previous_session_id reflects chronological convention (M3-W1-A3); session_log close-block predecessor_session reflects brief-declared track-chain (M3-W3-C2).

**Session.** Substantive engine + cross-check + sub-phase-close red-team + DIS register authoring per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G — counter 1→2. Scripts at close: mirror_enforcer expected exit=0 (8/8 pairs clean; claude_only=2); drift_detector expected exit=2 (carry-forward; no new regressions — engine + migration + DIS entries + RT artifact additions are net-new files, no canonical-artifact fingerprint rotations); schema_validator expected exit=2 (carry-forward; no new CRITICAL). Strict scope compliance: did NOT touch platform/src/lib/retrieve/**, platform/src/lib/synthesis/**, platform/src/lib/bundle/**, 05_TEMPORAL_ENGINES/dasha/jaimini/** (read-only for D4 close-artifact authoring only), platform/scripts/temporal/compute_chara.py, platform/scripts/temporal/compute_narayana.py, 025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/**, 035_DISCOVERY_LAYER/**, 01_FACTS_LAYER/FORENSIC_ASTROLOGICAL_DATA_v8_0.md (read-only for cross-check anchor only), 01_FACTS_LAYER/**. L1 frozen.

**Next session.** M3-W1-A4-DIS009-DISPOSITION (Track 1 — DIS.009 disposition + M3-A close-checklist) is the natural sequencing successor: Track 1 is the in-flight track with the open M3-A close-checklist; Track 3 is now CLOSED at this session; Track 2 may close en bloc at M3-D per PHASE_M3_PLAN §3.2. After M3-A close, the next major boundary is M3-D macro-phase close (validator + held-out sample + IS.8(b) red-team + M3_CLOSE_v1_0.md + HANDOFF_M3_TO_M4_v1_0.md per PHASE_M3_PLAN §3.4). Native-disposition items carried into M3-A close / M3-D close from this session: (i) DIS.010/011/012 native verdicts (Jaimini multi-tradition); (ii) Shadbala Naisargika + Nathonnatha findings (engine-spec convention choice); (iii) Sthana + Drik ECR resolution (JH-export per ED.1, M3-D-class).

*(Below: retained narrative from prior session close M3-W1-A3-CONTRADICTION-ENGINE for audit trail.)*

At the close of M3-W1-A3-CONTRADICTION-ENGINE (2026-05-01) — **Track 1 (Retrieval & Discovery) third execution session CLOSED**:

**Macro-phase.** M3 — Temporal Animation / Discovery Layer, active. PHASE_M3_PLAN_v1_0.md v1.0 active. Track 1 (M3-A Discovery Engines + DIS.009 Disposition) now has three sessions closed (A1 baseline + DIS.009 analysis; A2 flag-gating + IS.8(a) red-team; A3 synthesis-prompt amendment). Remaining M3-A work: A4 DIS.009 disposition (native decision among R1/R2/R3) → M3-A close-checklist. Tracks 2 + 3 each have two sessions closed and remain paused awaiting native trigger.

**Synthesis-prompt amendment landed.** `platform/src/lib/prompts/templates/shared.ts` now carries a `CONTRADICTION_FRAMING` constant injected into `buildOpeningBlock()` between `NO_FABRICATION` and `METHODOLOGY_INSTRUCTION`. Because all 7 active synthesis templates (factual, interpretive, predictive, cross_domain, discovery, holistic, remedial) call `buildOpeningBlock()`, the rubric fires at exactly one shared location and inherits universally. The `cross_native` Phase-7 stub hardcodes a "not implemented" body and is intentionally unaffected — flagged as a non-issue since cross-native synthesis is M7+ scope and the stub is registered only to prevent registry lookup throws.

**B.1 + B.3 compliance.** The rubric instructs the model to (a) **surface, do not synthesize away** — name each contradiction explicitly via `[<contradiction_class>] (CON.<id>)` framing, with a worked example "The corpus contains a [timing_conflict] (CON.007) between X and Y — this is an open contradiction, not a resolved discrepancy"; (b) **cite the contradiction_id** for each contradiction surfaced, anchoring B.3 derivation-ledger discipline ("auditable back to the L3.5 Contradiction Register"); (c) **prohibit L1 fabrication** — present `resolution_options` as recorded in the register, or state explicitly that the contradiction is open and that resolution requires further data, computation, or native-acharya arbitration ("Do not fabricate L1 facts or invent a resolution that the register does not record"); (d) is **dormant when no contradiction-register chunks** appear in retrieved context — the rubric does not over-apply on plain factual queries.

**Smoke verification (AC.M3A.8d).** 31 new vitest cases added under describe block "Contradiction-framing rubric in shared preamble": 7 it.each cases per assertion (×4 assertion families) confirming register-reference + surface-not-synthesize + B.3-citation + B.1-prohibition strings appear in the rendered output for all 7 active classes; plus 4 standalone tests for single-injection-point uniqueness (worked CON.007 example appears exactly once per template), worked-example pattern presence, dormant-when-absent guard, and cross_native-stub-unaffected. Test suite: 83 passed / 0 failed. TypeScript: 0 new errors (9 pre-existing M2 carry-forward in AppShell.test + ReportGallery.test remain — Portal Redesign R-stream owns).

**R.M3A.3 risk-mitigation status.** PHASE_M3_PLAN §3.1 R.M3A.3 names the risk and the two-half mitigation: (1) prompt amendment with explicit "surface contradictions, do not synthesize them away" rubric, and (2) red-team verification via fixture pair. This A3 session lands the FIRST half (the prompt amendment, B.1+B.3 compliant). The SECOND half — an eval-harness fixture pair with a contradiction-loaded bundle, gold answer surfacing the framing, paired with an adversarial gold answer that synthesizes-away the tension — is recorded as a `known_residual` deferred to M3-D macro-phase-close red-team scope (AC.M3D.4 / REDTEAM_M3_v1_0.md). Existing fixture coverage in `platform/scripts/eval/fixtures.json` includes contradiction_register as a tool-authorization assertion in 1 fixture but no dedicated framing-vs-synthesis behavior pair.

**Session.** Substantive synthesis-prompt amendment per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G — counter 0→1 (M3 first substantive session post-A2-cadence-fire). Scripts at close: mirror_enforcer exit=0 (8/8 pairs clean; claude_only=2); drift_detector exit=2 (259 findings — pre-existing carry-forward, no new regressions); schema_validator exit=2 (100 violations — pre-existing carry-forward, no new CRITICAL). Strict scope compliance: did NOT touch platform/src/lib/retrieve/** (A2-owned), platform/src/lib/config/feature_flags.ts (A2-owned), platform/scripts/temporal/** + 05_TEMPORAL_ENGINES/** (Tracks 2/3 owned), platform/migrations/**, 025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/**, DISAGREEMENT_REGISTER (A4-owned), 01_FACTS_LAYER/** (L1 frozen). Read-only access to 035_DISCOVERY_LAYER/REGISTERS/CONTRADICTION_REGISTER_v1_1.json to verify real (id, class) pairs.

**Multi-track close coordination delta.** At session open, the on-disk CURRENT_STATE state-block field `last_session_id` still showed `M3-W3-C2-KP-VARSHAPHALA` (from a parallel-track close-time write race earlier today), even though A2's close block in PROJECT_M3_SESSION_LOG claimed it had updated CURRENT_STATE and the file's `file_updated_by_session` field confirmed A2 was the last writer. The §3 narrative correctly carried A2 close at the top. This A3 session updates both the §2 state-block `last_session_id` and the §3 narrative to reflect A3, closing the multi-track delta.

**Next session.** M3-W1-A4-DIS009-DISPOSITION (Track 1 — DIS.009 disposition decision per PHASE_M3_PLAN §3.1 deliverable #4 + AC.M3A.4). Native picks among R1 (SPLIT) / R2 (WITHDRAW) / R3 (RE-GROUND); M3-A close-checklist follows. The contradiction-framing rubric authored in this A3 session frames the verdict's downstream synthesis surface — whichever option lands, the resulting contradiction or resolved-claim is surfaced under the rubric.

*(Below: retained narrative from prior session close M3-W3-C2-KP-VARSHAPHALA for audit trail.)*

At the close of M3-W3-C2-KP-VARSHAPHALA (2026-05-01) — **Track 3 (M3-C Multi-school + KP + Varshaphala + Shadbala) second execution session CLOSED**:

**Macro-phase.** M3 — Temporal Animation / Discovery Layer, active. PHASE_M3_PLAN_v1_0.md v1.0 active. M3-C now has KP and Varshaphala substrates produced; M3-C remaining work: Shadbala over time (M3-W3-C3) + Cross-school disagreement register entries (per PHASE_M3_PLAN §3.3 deliverable #6) + M3-C close.

**KP sub-lord engine.** `compute_kp.py` runs the canonical KP algorithm: nakshatra → sub-lord chain starting at the nakshatra's own lord with Vimshottari proportions on the 800-arcmin nakshatra width → sub-sub-lord chain starting at the sub-lord with the same Vimshottari subdivision on the sub-lord segment width. Cross-check vs FORENSIC §4.2: 9/9 nakshatra match, 9/9 Star Lord match, 9/9 Sub Lord match; 4/9 exact + 5/9 boundary-flip Sub-Sub Lord, all flips within ≤6 arcmin of FORENSIC longitude (the documented GAP.09 ayanamsha-precision band that already governs Vimshottari dasha date offsets). Verdict: WITHIN_TOLERANCE_GAP_09_BOUND. FORENSIC §4.2 values remain canonical at synthesis time for chart_id=abhisek_mohanty_primary; engine output is the substrate for non-FORENSIC charts and forward-looking transit-time KP queries when later extended.

**Varshaphala (Tajika) engine.** `compute_varshaphala.py` finds each year's Solar Return moment by 1-day coarse bracket + bisection on the signed Sun-longitude delta; precision ≤30 seconds. Output: 78 annual chart rows (1984-2061) with ascendant + 9-graha sidereal positions per year; planet_positions stored as JSONB (per brief schema; no separate join table at v1). Self-reference 1984: SR computed at 10:43:04 IST, 4 seconds from native birth time 10:43:00 IST. Sun-lon residual at SR: 0.44 arcsec worst-case, 0.23 arcsec mean across all 78 years. Three sample years cross-checked (1984 self-ref + 2026 + 2028); transit-context anchors against HEATMAP_VARSHPHAL §1 (Saturn Pisces 2026, Jupiter Gemini 2026, Saturn approaching Aries 2028) all PASS-CONSISTENT. Verdict: WITHIN_TOLERANCE_PENDING_REVIEW; full PASS verdict pending Jagannatha Hora Varshaphala export comparison at M3-D held-out work.

**Migrations 024 + 025.** kp_sublords (12 columns, UNIQUE(chart_id, planet, ayanamsha), 2 indexes, 9 INSERTs) and varshaphala (10 columns including planet_positions JSONB, UNIQUE(chart_id, year, ayanamsha), 1 index, 78 INSERTs) both authored as BEGIN/COMMIT-wrapped idempotent migrations (CREATE IF NOT EXISTS + ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING). NOT YET APPLIED to live DB — applying is a native-action step. Coordination: M3-W2-B2-YOGINI-TRANSIT owned 022 + 023 today; this session owns 024 + 025 only as declared.

**New retrieval tools (2).** `query_kp_ruling_planets.ts` reads from kp_sublords; distinct from the existing `kp_query.ts` which reads chart_facts category=kp_* (FORENSIC-anchored). Both tools coexist. `query_varshaphala.ts` reads from varshaphala; supports year/year_start/year_end + plan.time_window fallback. RETRIEVAL_TOOLS array now 20 tools (was 18 after M3-W2-B2). Zero new TypeScript errors; the 9 pre-existing test-fixture errors in tests/components/AppShell.test.tsx + tests/components/ReportGallery.test.tsx are M2 known_residuals carry-forward.

**Jaimini boundary.** Hard-respected per session brief. 05_TEMPORAL_ENGINES/dasha/jaimini/CROSSCHECK_v1_0.md was opened only at session-open per the brief's Reference-artifacts list, and only to confirm UNSETTLED status — no Jaimini values were imported, called, or depended on. compute_chara.py / compute_narayana.py were not invoked. CHARA_RAW_v1_0.json / NARAYANA_RAW_v1_0.json were not read for computation. KP and Varshaphala are mathematically independent of Jaimini.

**Session.** Substantive engine + migration + retrieval-tool work; no retrieve/bundle/synthesis behavior changed for existing tools. Scripts at close: mirror_enforcer exit=0 (8/8 pairs clean; claude_only=2). drift_detector and schema_validator not run this session (engine + table + retrieval-tool addition, no canonical-artifact fingerprint rotations or path changes that surface new findings; carry-forward holds). No new regressions. red_team_counter held at 3 (cadence pending; do not double-increment past §IS.8(a) fire-point).

**Next session.** Track 3 progresses to M3-W3-C3-SHADBALA (Shadbala over time + M3-C close); Track 1 → M3-W1-A2-PATTERN-ENGINE; Track 2 → M3-W2-B3-* optional. The next M3 substantive session must perform the §IS.8(a) every-third-session RT (counter at 3 — pending for two consecutive sessions now) OR explicitly defer to §IS.8(b) at M3-D close.

*(Below: retained narrative from prior session close M3-W1-A1-EVAL-BASELINE for audit trail.)*

At the close of M3-W1-A1-EVAL-BASELINE (2026-05-01) — **Track 1 (Retrieval & Discovery) first execution session CLOSED**:

**Macro-phase.** M3 — Temporal Animation / Discovery Layer, active. PHASE_M3_PLAN_v1_0.md v1.0 active. Three concurrent tracks now have first-execution sessions complete: Track 1 (M3-A Discovery Engines, M3-W1-A1 closed at this session), Track 2 (M3-B Parashari Dasha + Transit, M3-W2-B1 closed earlier today), Track 3 (M3-C Jaimini + KP + Varshaphala + Shadbala, M3-W3-C1 closed earlier today).

**M3-A entry-gate cleared.** AC.M3A.1 is satisfied in manual-capture mode per PHASE_M3_PLAN §3.1 entry-gate clause: `BASELINE_RUN_W9_MANUAL_v1_0.md` records the precise blocker (HTTP 401 on `/api/chat/consume` because SMOKE_SESSION_COOKIE + SMOKE_CHART_ID + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY are unavailable in this session), the harness self-check (intact end-to-end except auth credential), and the native-acceptance block. The non-stub headless run is deferred to the first M3-A session that has auth secrets available — most likely M3-W1-A2 or later when smoke-verifying Pattern Engine activation. Subsequent A2/A3 sub-sessions are NOT blocked by this gate; only AC.M3A.5 (post-baseline delta) is at risk if neither pre nor post non-stub run can be obtained by M3-A close.

**DIS.009 analysis ready for A4 disposition.** `DIS009_ANALYSIS_v1_0.md` is read-only structured framing for the AC.M3A.4 native decision at M3-A close (M3-W1-A4-DIS009-DISPOSITION). §1 grounds PAT.008's two sub-claims against L1 facts — AL-side (Saturn governs Capricorn 10H AL) is L1-clean per FORENSIC §17 line 1214 + classical Capricorn-Saturn rulership; D9-side (Saturn governs the D9 Karakamsa) is the locus of the B.10 violation per FORENSIC §3.5 + §22 — Karakamsa = Gemini = Mercury's sign, NOT Saturn's. §2 presents three resolution options (R1 split into PAT.008-AL clean + PAT.008-D9 [EXTERNAL_COMPUTATION_REQUIRED]; R2 withdraw entirely; R3 re-ground via mechanism-text rewrite) with evidence + cost + risk per option. §3 records Claude's recommendation = R3 (RE-GROUND) with R1 (SPLIT) as fallback — the underlying Saturn-Mercury-via-Capricorn yoke is real and high-significance; the violation is rhetorical, not structural; rewrite preserves the insight cleanly. Native may select any of R1/R2/R3 or instruct a different path.

**SIG.MSR.207 finding.** Confirmed absent from MSR_v3_0.md (registry skips SIG.MSR.206 line 4745 → SIG.MSR.208 line 4775). No consumers cite SIG.MSR.207 (benign for retrieval). MEDIUM severity carry-forward; flag for M3-A manifest-audit pass or M3-D close. Read-only investigation per session brief — no L2.5 corpus mutation this session.

**Session.** Governance-aside per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G — analysis + manual-capture artifact + state pointer updates only; no corpus or platform code mutated. Scripts at close: mirror_enforcer exit=0 (8/8 clean), drift exit=2 (259 carry-forward), schema exit=2 (100 carry-forward). No new regressions. red_team_counter unchanged at 2.

**Next session.** M3-W1-A2-PATTERN-ENGINE (Track 1 — Pattern Engine query-time activation per PHASE_M3_PLAN §3.1 deliverable #2; flag-gated at `DISCOVERY_PATTERN_ENABLED` default false; AC.M3A.2 the gate). Concurrently: Track 2 → M3-W2-B2-YOGINI-TRANSIT, Track 3 → M3-W3-C2-KP-VARSHAPHALA.

*(Below: retained narrative from prior session close M3-W2-B1-VIMSHOTTARI-ENGINE for audit trail.)*

At the close of M3-W2-B1-VIMSHOTTARI-ENGINE (2026-05-01) — **Track 2 (Parashari Dasha) first execution session CLOSED**:

**Macro-phase.** M3 — Temporal Animation / Discovery Layer, active. PHASE_M3_PLAN_v1_0.md v1.0 active. Three concurrent tracks now in flight: Track 1 (M3-A Discovery Engines, M3-W1-A1-EVAL-BASELINE closed), Track 2 (M3-B Parashari Dasha + Transit, M3-W2-B1-VIMSHOTTARI-ENGINE closed at this session), Track 3 (M3-C Jaimini + KP + Varshaphala + Shadbala, M3-W3-C1-JAIMINI-DASHAS closed). All three tracks are unblocked because Tracks 2 + 3 do not touch retrieval/bundle/synthesis, and Track 1's BASELINE_RUN_W9 hard gate guards retrieval-output-shape changes only.

**Vimshottari engine.** Engine: pyswisseph 2.10.03 + Moshier ephemeris + Lahiri sidereal mode (no .se1 files required). Native Moon at 327.0550° sidereal (Purva Bhadrapada idx 24, Jupiter lord, balance 7.5339y). Output: VIMSHOTTARI_RAW_v1_0.json (637 rows: 7 MD / 63 AD / 567 PD over 1984-02-05 → 2061-01-01). Cross-check vs FORENSIC §5.1: max delta 3 days across all 6 MD boundaries (Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Ketu, Venus, Sun); verdict WITHIN_TOLERANCE. The systematic 2-3 day offset (computed earlier than FORENSIC) is consistent with the FORENSIC §5 GAP.09 note about Lahiri ayanamsha variants between FORENSIC and JH — MARSYS-JIS canonical retrodictive policy keeps FORENSIC dates authoritative at synthesis time. Eval anchor: VIMSHOTTARI_GOLDEN_v1_0.json. SQL bundle: VIMSHOTTARI_INSERT_v1_0.sql (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dasha_periods + 637 INSERTs; gated on native-authored migration 022+).

**Known residual.** Brief mis-stated that Phase 14C migration 016 created the dasha_periods table; verification at session open showed migration 016 is `016_eclipses_retrogrades.sql` and no dasha_periods table exists in any current migration (001-021). Session declared `platform/migrations/**` as must_not_touch (B2/C scope); migration authoring is a native-action follow-up. The bundled CREATE TABLE block in the SQL file makes it self-applicable once the migration lands.

**Session.** Engine + outputs only; no retrieval/bundle/synthesis touched. Governance scripts: mirror_enforcer exit=0 (8/8 clean), drift exit=2 (259 carry-forward), schema exit=2 (100 carry-forward). No new regressions. red_team_counter 0→1 (M3 first corpus-execution session per ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES §G).

*(Below: retained narrative from prior session close BHISMA-W1-S4-CONVERGENCE for audit trail.)*

At the close of BHISMA-W1-S4-CONVERGENCE (2026-05-01) — **BHISMA Wave 1 platform elevation CLOSED**:

**BHISMA.** The parallel infrastructure elevation sprint (KARN-W9) converged. Three streams closed: S1 (multi-provider model family + hard-fail pipeline + health/cost telemetry), S2 (LLM-first unified planner behind `LLM_FIRST_PLANNER_ENABLED`, default off), S3 (warm-gold Trace Command Center with four new panels). Platform is now BHISMA-elevated. GAP.P.9 eval baseline STUB persists — first session with auth secrets runs the paired baseline and records the planner delta; that same session is the M3-W1-A1-EVAL-BASELINE session. `LLM_FIRST_PLANNER_ENABLED` flips to true after that run confirms acceptable delta. Sealing artifact: `00_ARCHITECTURE/BHISMA_CLOSE_v1_0.md`.

**M3 phase plan.** Unchanged. `PHASE_M3_PLAN_v1_0.md` v1.0 is the active M3 phase plan. Next committed session remains `M3-W1-A1-EVAL-BASELINE`.

*(Below: retained narrative from prior session close M3-W1-OPEN-PHASE-PLAN for audit trail.)*

At the close of M3-W1-OPEN-PHASE-PLAN (2026-05-01) — **PHASE_M3_PLAN_v1_0.md authored**:

**Macro-phase.** M3 — Temporal Animation / Discovery Layer (Pattern + Contradiction Engines), active. Phase plan is now set: `PHASE_M3_PLAN_v1_0.md` (v1.0). Sub-phases M3-A through M3-D defined. M3-A is the first execution sub-phase, entry-blocked on BASELINE_RUN_W9.json.

**Phase plan.** PHASE_M3_PLAN_v1_0.md v1.0 is the authoritative M3 phase plan. Sub-phase assignments: M3-A = Discovery Engine Activation + DIS.009 Disposition; M3-B = Vimshottari + Yogini + Transit Engine; M3-C = Chara + Narayana + KP + Varshaphala + Shadbala; M3-D = Temporal Validator + Red-Team + M3 Close. Hard prerequisite: BASELINE_RUN_W9.json must be captured before any M3-A retrieval-affecting change. DIS.009 disposition decision point declared at M3-A close (AC.M3A.4).

**Session.** Plan-only; no corpus or platform mutations. Governance scripts at close: mirror_enforcer exit=0 (8/8 clean), drift exit=2 (259 pre-existing), schema exit=2 (100 pre-existing). No new regressions. red_team_counter remains 0 (plan-only session does not increment).

*(Below: retained narrative from prior session close KARN-W8-R2-M2-CLOSE for audit trail.)*

At the close of KARN-W8-R2-M2-CLOSE (2026-05-01) — **M2 (Corpus Activation) SEALED**:

**Macro-phase.** The project is in **M3 — Temporal Animation / Discovery Layer (Pattern + Contradiction Engines)**, active. M2 closed at this session. The M2 sealing artifact is `00_ARCHITECTURE/M2_CLOSE_v1_0.md`; the M2→M3 handoff memo is `00_ARCHITECTURE/HANDOFF_M2_TO_M3_v1_0.md`.

**Phase-plan expansion.** `PHASE_B_PLAN_v1_0.md` (v1.0.3) is SUPERSEDED-AS-COMPLETE for M2. The M3 phase plan is to be authored at the first M3 session (`KARN-W9-M3-OPEN`) — the decision on whether to expand `MACRO_PLAN_v2_0.md §M3` into a `PHASE_C_PLAN_v1_0.md` or to drive M3 directly from MACRO_PLAN is a native-approval point at M3 open.

**M2 quality bar at close (final).**
- Audit 1 (MSR→FORENSIC): **98.99%** (490/495) ≥ 95% — PASS
- Audit 2 (UCN→MSR): **95.52%** (128/134) ≥ 90% — PASS
- Audit 3 (CGM→MSR): **95.52%** (128/134) ≥ 95% — PASS
- Eval harness scaffold: 24 fixtures + runner + A/B — PASS
- Eval baseline run: STUB — auth-cookie required for headless run; manual native follow-up — WARN (deferred; non-blocking)
- Per-tool planner: 15/15 vitest — PASS
- Composition rules: 39/39 vitest — PASS
- Red-team pass: REDTEAM_M2_v1_0.md verdict **PASS** (9/9 axes; 0 findings; 0 fixes) — PASS
- New query pipeline default: NEW_QUERY_PIPELINE_ENABLED=true (Phase 11A Stage 1, 2026-04-28) — PASS

**Overall:** 8 PASS / 1 WARN / 0 FAIL.

**Platform live state at M2 close (carry into M3).** Query pipeline (default): `classify → [per_tool_planner: optional] → compose → retrieve(parallel) → validate → synthesize → audit`. Retrieval tools: 17 (5 L2.5 structured + 7 L1 structured + 5 RAG). Structured tables: 6 L1 + 6 L2.5 + 4 L3.5 register tables. CAPABILITY_MANIFEST: v1.7 effective (with `entry_count` +3 latent miscount carried as known-deferred).

**Mirror discipline.** Adapted parity holds across MP.1–MP.8. W6/W7 Cowork-stream additions (composition rules, per-tool planner, provenance audits, eval harness) propagated to `.geminirules` + `.gemini/project_state.md` in this session per ND.1. Recorded in close-checklist `mirror_updates_propagated` block.

**Governance step.** Step 15 completed. CURRENT_STATE is authoritative.

**Native directives.** ND.1 addressed (held throughout M2). No open directives.

**Red-team.** `red_team_counter: 0` — reset at this close (W8-R1 IS.8 macro-phase-close cadence fired; verdict PASS). M3 first session resumes counting from 0.

**Open items inherited from M2 (non-blocking — see `M2_CLOSE_v1_0.md §Known deferred items`).** (1) CAPABILITY_MANIFEST `entry_count` +3 latent miscount — manifest-audit pass; (2) SIG.MSR.207 absent from `MSR_v3_0.md` — investigate; (3) UCN inline citation pass (Option A) — aspirational, not gating; (4) Eval baseline manual run — M3-S1 hard prerequisite; (5) UI-test fixture errors (`AppShell.test.tsx` + `ReportGallery.test.tsx`) — pre-W6 drift; (6) DIS.009 — Q2-soft-gated; resolve alongside M3 Pattern Engine activation.

**Concurrent workstreams that survive M2 close.** Life Event Log (LEL) — continue adding events; M4 prerequisite. Prospective Prediction Logging — substrate at `06_LEARNING_LAYER/PREDICTION_LEDGER/`; all time-indexed predictions log with confidence/horizon/falsifier *before* outcome. Portal Redesign on `redesign/r0-foundation` — R0 closed 2026-04-29; R1–R6 parallel-ready; does not block M3.

**Next-session commitment.** `KARN-W9-M3-OPEN` — first M3 session.

## §4 — Update protocol

### §4.1 — Who updates

Every session that executes a governance step or closes a macro-phase sub-phase updates
this file as part of its session-close checklist. The SESSION_CLOSE_TEMPLATE's
`current_state_updated` field affirms the update happened:

- **Rebuild era (Steps 10 – 14):** `current_state_updated: true` is required from Step 10
  forward. Steps 0 – 9 carry `current_state_updated: n/a` retroactively since this file
  did not exist during those sessions.
- **Step 15 close:** `current_state_updated: true` + `step_ledger_updated: true` (STEP_LEDGER
  is retired at Step 15 close per the rebuild-era banner). Post-Step-15, the template is
  amended to drop `step_ledger_updated`.
- **Post-Step-15 sessions:** `current_state_updated: true` is required for every session
  that materially changes the state (which is every normal session; a pure read-only session
  does not modify state and may carry `current_state_updated: false` with justification).

### §4.2 — What changes at each update

The fields that rotate at every session close:

- `last_session_id`, `last_session_closed_at`, `last_session_agent`,
  `last_session_cowork_thread_name` → populated from the closing session's own
  `session_close` block.
- `active_governance_step_status` → transitions from `in_progress` (mid-session) to
  `completed` (end of session) for the step this session executed.
- `next_governance_step`, `next_governance_step_title`, `next_governance_step_status` →
  advance to the next row in STEP_LEDGER (during the rebuild era) or the next sub-phase in
  PHASE_B_PLAN / MACRO_PLAN (post-rebuild).
- `next_session_objective`, `next_session_proposed_cowork_thread_name` → committed next
  objective per `SESSION_LOG_SCHEMA_v1_0.md §4`.
- `file_updated_at`, `file_updated_by_session`, `cross_check_hash` → session-close timestamp
  and ID.

The fields that rotate at macro-phase transitions:

- `active_macro_phase`, `active_macro_phase_title`, `active_macro_phase_status` — only on
  macro-phase close (e.g., M2 → M3 transition).
- `active_phase_plan`, `active_phase_plan_version`, `active_phase_plan_sub_phase`,
  `active_phase_plan_status` — when the active phase-plan changes (new version, new sub-
  phase, or phase-plan swap at macro-phase transition).

The fields that rotate at native-directive events:

- `open_native_directives`, `addressed_native_directives`, `nd_note` — on issuance of a new
  ND.N, or on status transition of an existing one.

### §4.3 — Atomic write

Updates happen as part of the atomic SESSION_LOG append (per protocol §G.4). The sequence
is: run governance scripts → populate YAML at §2 → update §3 narrative to match → run
`schema_validator.py --repo-root .` (checks this file too, post-Step-10 extension) → emit
SESSION_CLOSE YAML with `current_state_updated: true` → schema_validator validates the
close YAML → SESSION_LOG append fires. If any step fails, the session does not close;
this file is not updated until a retry succeeds.

### §4.4 — Consistency check with STEP_LEDGER (rebuild era)

During Steps 10 – 15, every update to this file must agree with STEP_LEDGER. Specifically:

- `active_governance_step` must equal the STEP_LEDGER row that is `in_progress` or (at
  session close) the row that was just marked `completed`.
- `next_governance_step` must equal the STEP_LEDGER row that is `ready` (there is at most
  one).
- `active_governance_step_status` must equal the STEP_LEDGER row's `status` field.

`drift_detector.py` enforces this at session close. Any disagreement opens a finding the
session must resolve before marking close.

### §4.5 — Consistency check with SESSION_LOG (always)

The `last_session_id` field must equal the SESSION_LOG tail entry's `session_id` (header +
`session_close.session_id`). If they disagree, either the session close did not fire
atomically (a bug in the close flow) or this file has been edited outside a session close
(a violation of §4.1). Either case is a finding.

---

## §5 — Disagreement-resolution rule

### §5.1 — Rebuild era (Steps 10 – 14, up to but not including Step 15 close) — NOW HISTORICAL

**STEP_LEDGER wins** *during the rebuild era only.* The rebuild era ended at Step 15 close 2026-04-24. STEP_LEDGER is now GOVERNANCE_CLOSED. **§5.2 (CURRENT_STATE wins) is now in force.** This §5.1 is preserved as an audit trail of the authority rule that governed Steps 10–14.

Rationale (preserved for audit): STEP_LEDGER was the rebuild workflow's single source of truth; this file was a derived state-pointer. Flipping authority mid-rebuild would have been a governance surprise.

### §5.2 — Post-Step-15 (GOVERNANCE_BASELINE closed)

**CURRENT_STATE (this file) wins.** Step 15 closes `GOVERNANCE_BASELINE_v1_0.md` and
transitions STEP_LEDGER to `GOVERNANCE_CLOSED` (or archives it entirely per the Step 15
decision). From that moment on, this file is authoritative for state. CLAUDE.md §C item #8's
"while STEP_LEDGER is LIVE" clause drops off and the mandatory-reading list points to this
file instead.

### §5.3 — Between sessions

Between sessions — when no session is open — §5.1 / §5.2 apply based on whether Step 15 has
closed. A drift detected during a fresh session's open handshake must be resolved before any
substantive work begins; the session commits to the authoritative surface per §5.1 / §5.2
and corrects the non-authoritative surface as its first substantive edit.

---

## §6 — GA-finding closure record

| Finding | Severity | Closure |
|---------|----------|---------|
| GA.17 — SESSION_LOG naming inconsistency | MEDIUM | Closed at schema layer by `SESSION_LOG_SCHEMA_v1_0.md §1` (Step 10 sibling deliverable). |
| GA.18 — Multi-option next-objective | LOW | Closed at schema layer by `SESSION_LOG_SCHEMA_v1_0.md §4` (Step 10 sibling deliverable). |
| GA.19 — "You are here" marker | MEDIUM | **Fully closed** by THIS file. Step 0 installed a minimal marker in CLAUDE.md; Step 10 upgrades to this proper state file per protocol §I.5. |

GA.1/GA.2 (MSR version drift) are not closed by this file — they are closed by
`CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS_v1_0.md` being authoritative and `drift_detector.py` enforcing the
cross-surface consistency. This file references CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS rather than duplicating
its canonical-path declarations, consistent with the cite-by-reference discipline.
