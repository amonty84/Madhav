artifact: FILE_REGISTRY_v1_2.md
version: 1.2
status: SUPERSEDED
superseded_on: 2026-04-24
superseded_by: FILE_REGISTRY_v1_3.md (Step 7 of the Step 0→15 governance rebuild)
date: 2026-04-24
scope: Complete registry of final/current MARSYS-JIS corpus files
supersedes: FILE_REGISTRY_v1_1.md (closed 2026-04-23 at Step 5; superseded 2026-04-24 at Step 5A of the Step 0→15 governance rebuild); FILE_REGISTRY_v1_0.md (closed 2026-04-19; superseded 2026-04-23 at Step 5)
changelog:
  - v1.2 (2026-04-24, Step 5A of the Step 0→15 governance rebuild):
    (a) §9.1 (Architecture & Governance) — PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE row updated from v2.1 to
        `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_2.md` CURRENT, with v2.1 SUPERSEDED and added to §8
        Archival. v2.2 absorbs the Macro Plan M1–M10 arc (§D.10, §D.11), the Learning
        Layer substrate summary, the Multi-Agent Collaboration workstream with the ND.1
        mirror-pair inventory (MP.1–MP.8 in v2.2 §D.11.2), the corrected §E file tree,
        and the new §L Governance Rebuild Reference. §B principles, §C five-layer
        pyramid, §F existing namespaces, §H quality standards, §J resolved decisions
        preserved verbatim in v2.2. Produced under STEP_5A_PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_REFRESH
        per `STEP_BRIEFS/STEP_5A_PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_REFRESH_v1_0.md`.
    (b) §8 Archival — PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_1.md added as superseded by v2.2;
        FILE_REGISTRY_v1_1.md self-entry added as superseded by v1.2 (this file).
    (c) §2 (L1) — no change.
    (d) §4 (L2.5) — no change (MSR_v3_0 row introduced at v1.1 remains CURRENT).
    (e) No schema changes; additive + corrective only.
    (f) Lineage chain: FILE_INDEX_v1_0 → FILE_REGISTRY_v1_0 → FILE_REGISTRY_v1_1 → FILE_REGISTRY_v1_2 (this).
  - v1.1 (2026-04-23, Step 5 of the Step 0→15 governance rebuild):
    (a) §2 (L1) — corrected LIFE_EVENT_LOG row to LEL v1_2 (file already at
        v1.2; registry row was accurate but formatting aligned).
    (b) §4 (L2.5) — corrected the MSR row from `MSR_v2_0.md` (500 signals,
        internal v2.2) to the CURRENT canonical `MSR_v3_0.md` at 499 signals
        per GROUNDING_AUDIT_v1_0 §GA.1 and per CLAUDE.md §Canonical corpus
        artifact paths. Added MSR_v2_0.md to §8 Archival. This resolves the
        GA.1 registry-discipline finding that the v1.0 registry's §4 MSR row
        was out of date relative to the CURRENT corpus.
    (c) §9 (Architecture & Governance) — added rows for the Step 0→15
        governance-rebuild artifact family produced since v1.0 registry
        publication: MACRO_PLAN_v2_0.md (CURRENT), MACRO_PLAN_v1_0.md
        (SUPERSEDED), MACRO_PLAN_CRITIQUE_v1_0.md (CLOSED),
        MACRO_PLAN_REVISION_SPEC_v1_0.md (CLOSED),
        MACRO_PLAN_REDTEAM_v1_0.md (CLOSED), STEP_LEDGER_v1_0.md (LIVE),
        STEP_BRIEFS/ (16 briefs; LIVE), GROUNDING_AUDIT_v1_0.md (CLOSED),
        NATIVE_DIRECTIVES_FOR_REVISION_v1_0.md (LIVING),
        CONVERSATION_NAMING_CONVENTION_v1_0.md (CURRENT),
        PHASE_B_PLAN_v1_0.md v1.0.2 (CURRENT),
        PHASE_B_PLAN_v1_0_RECONCILER_PASS_v1_0.md (CLOSED).
    (d) §8 Archival — MACRO_PLAN_v1_0.md added as superseded by v2.0;
        MSR_v2_0.md added as superseded by MSR_v3_0.md; FILE_REGISTRY_v1_0.md
        self-entry added as superseded by v1.1 (predecessor of this file).
    (e) No schema changes; additive + corrective only.
    (f) FILE_INDEX_v1_0.md supersession chain unchanged (FILE_INDEX_v1_0.md
        → FILE_REGISTRY_v1_0.md → FILE_REGISTRY_v1_1.md → FILE_REGISTRY_v1_2.md).
  - v1.0 (2026-04-19): Created as registry successor to FILE_INDEX_v1_0.md
    (Session 36, stale). Captured 75 current files + 29 archival.

# MARSYS-JIS File Registry — Final Corpus (v1.2)

> **⚠ SUPERSEDED (2026-04-24) by `FILE_REGISTRY_v1_3.md`** at Step 7 of the Step 0→15 governance rebuild. v1.3 is additive + corrective relative to v1.2: it registers the Step 7 artifacts (CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS, SESSION_OPEN_TEMPLATE, SESSION_CLOSE_TEMPLATE, DISAGREEMENT_REGISTER, the three governance scripts) and adds two new columns (`canonical_artifact_id`, `mirror_obligations` summary) per `GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL_v1_0.md §D.2`. Do not cite v1.2 for CURRENT state; retained for lineage tracing only. See v1.3 frontmatter changelog.

**Subject**: Abhisek Mohanty, b. 1984-02-05, 10:43 IST, Bhubaneswar
**Branch**: `feature/amjis-platform`
**Registry date**: 2026-04-24 (v1.2 published at Step 5A of the Step 0→15 governance rebuild; supersedes v1.1 dated 2026-04-23 and v1.0 dated 2026-04-19)

This registry lists only the **current authoritative version** of each artifact.
Superseded versions are collected in §8 (Archival). Tooling and process files are in §9–§10.

The v1.2 revision is additive + corrective relative to v1.1: the PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE row in §9.1 is bumped from v2.1 to `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_2.md` per the Step 5A brief. v2.1 moves to §8 Archival. No schema change; no column added.

### Rows updated
- §9.1 (Architecture & Governance): PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE row bumped from `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_1.md` (CURRENT) to `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_2.md` (CURRENT). A second row added for `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_1.md` (SUPERSEDED) with a §8 Archival cross-reference. Rationale: Step 5A of the Step 0→15 governance rebuild published v2.2 on 2026-04-24 per `STEP_BRIEFS/STEP_5A_PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_REFRESH_v1_0.md`.

### Rows added to §8 (Archival)
- Architecture / Governance: `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_1.md` → `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_2.md`; `FILE_REGISTRY_v1_1.md` → this file (`FILE_REGISTRY_v1_2.md`).

### Schema
No change. Additive + corrective revision only; no column added, no row format changed, no semantics altered.
