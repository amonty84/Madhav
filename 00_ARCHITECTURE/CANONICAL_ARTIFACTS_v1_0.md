artifact: CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS_v1_0.md
version: 1.0
status: "SUPERSEDED (2026-04-27 — canonical-path registry function migrated to CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.json; mirror_pairs migrated to manifest_overrides.yaml mirror_pairs section; retained in place for historical audit)"
produced_during: STEP_7_GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_IMPLEMENTATION (2026-04-24)
implements: GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL_v1_0.md §E
authoritative_side: Claude (the machine-readable canonical-path registry — Claude-resident by
  construction; its role is to be the single source of truth that every other surface imports
  from rather than duplicates)
mirror_obligations: >
  This file itself is Claude-only (no Gemini counterpart). Its §2 Mirror-pair inventory is the
  machine-readable declaration of every Claude ↔ Gemini mirror pair on the project, per ND.1.
  The §1 table is the authoritative artifact inventory — other surfaces cite it; it does not
  cite them.
supersedes: (none — first version of this registry)
schema_version: 1.0
  # Changes that would break machine-parse compatibility force a major bump (v2.0). Changes
  # that add rows / optional fields are minor (v1.X). Changes that rotate a fingerprint in an
  # existing row are patch (v1.0.Y).
update_rules:
  - "Rotate a fingerprint whenever the file content changes. Record the rotating session in
    `last_verified_session` + `last_verified_on`."
  - "Add a row for a new canonical artifact at the session that admits it. Bump to v1.X."
  - "Change a mirror pair's authoritative_side / mirror_mode / known_asymmetries only via
    an explicit ND.N directive or a native-approved protocol amendment; bump to v1.X."
  - "Never carry a SUPERSEDED row. Superseded versions live in FILE_REGISTRY §8 Archival."
  - "Never duplicate FILE_REGISTRY's inventory. CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS lists only canonical
    artifacts — those with a stable canonical_id. Closed artifacts (STEP_BRIEFS, CRITIQUEs,
    REDTEAMs, SESSION_LOG entries) do not appear here unless they also carry a CURRENT
    canonical role (e.g., STEP_LEDGER, which is LIVE until Step 15 closure)."
consumers:
  - platform/scripts/governance/drift_detector.py — reads §1 path + fingerprint per canonical_id
    as the authoritative source for cross-surface comparison (protocol §H.3)
  - platform/scripts/governance/schema_validator.py — reads §1 to resolve artifact-class schemas
    and §2 to validate mirror-pair structural equivalence (protocol §I.3)
  - platform/scripts/governance/mirror_enforcer.py — reads §2 as the full MP.1–MP.8 inventory
    (protocol §J / ND.1)
  - 00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_OPEN_TEMPLATE_v1_0.md — canonical_artifact_fingerprint_check block
    reads declared fingerprints from §1
  - 00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_CLOSE_TEMPLATE_v1_0.md — registry_updates_made.canonical_artifacts
    block writes back to §1 when fingerprints rotate
  - Step 9 (CLAUDE.md rebuild) — CLAUDE.md's canonical-path table is replaced by a
    cite-CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS-by-reference rule
changelog:
  - v1.0 (2026-04-24, Step 7 of the Step 0→15 governance rebuild):
    Initial registry. §1 carries one row per CURRENT canonical artifact (19 rows including
    CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS self-entry). §2 carries the MP.1–MP.8 mirror-pair inventory
    transcribed machine-readably from PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_2.md §D.11.2. Fingerprints
    computed at Step 7 session close. ND.1 global status flip fires at this session's close
    per directive consumption-matrix close condition.

# CANONICAL ARTIFACTS v1.0
## MARSYS-JIS Project — Machine-Readable Canonical-Path Registry

*Implements `GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL_v1_0.md §E`. Single source of truth for canonical artifact paths, versions, fingerprints, and mirror obligations. Every other governance surface imports from here or cites it by reference — no other surface may declare a canonical version without citing this file.*

*Produced in Step 7 of the Step 0 → Step 15 governance rebuild.*

---

## §0 — How to read this registry

- **§1 Canonical artifact table** — one row per canonical_id. Each row is a YAML-block header (for machine parse) plus a human-readable summary paragraph. The YAML block is authoritative; the paragraph is a reading aid.
- **§2 Mirror-pair inventory** — one row per mirror pair (MP.1 through MP.8 as of v1.0). Each row is a YAML-block header + summary paragraph. The YAML is authoritative.
- **§3 Asymmetry declarations** — per-pair `known_asymmetries`, duplicated here for grep-friendliness. Drift between this section and the §2 rows' `known_asymmetries` field is itself a finding (`asymmetry_declaration_drift`).

**Machine parse.** A script consumes this file by (a) locating all fenced `yaml` blocks under §1 or §2 headers, (b) parsing each as YAML, (c) indexing by `canonical_id` or `pair_id`. Text outside fenced blocks is documentation and is ignored by the parser.

**Fingerprint rotation.** When a file's content changes, the next session that touches it updates the row's `fingerprint_sha256` and records the rotating session in `last_verified_session` + `last_verified_on`. Any fingerprint mismatch between declared and observed (at session open) fails the `canonical_artifact_fingerprint_check` block in the session-open handshake — indicates silent file mutation.

**Bootstrap note.** Step 7 is the session that creates this file. The canonical_artifact_fingerprint_check block of the Step 7 session-open handshake fills rows with "n/a-bootstrap" because there is no prior CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS to check against. Steps 8 onward fully populate the check.

## §1 — Canonical artifact table

Sorted by layer: L1 → L2.5 → Architecture/Governance (sub-sorted by canonical_id).

### L1 — Facts Layer

#### FORENSIC

```yaml
canonical_id: FORENSIC
path: 01_FACTS_LAYER/FORENSIC_ASTROLOGICAL_DATA_v8_0.md
version: "8.0"
status: CURRENT
fingerprint_sha256: 85ca34690780c749eb155134b126dee5dffc9514c7611022385651ae2f2fa101
mirror_obligations:
  claude_side: 01_FACTS_LAYER/FORENSIC_ASTROLOGICAL_DATA_v8_0.md
  gemini_side: null
  mirror_mode: claude_only
  authoritative_side: claude
  asymmetries: "L1 facts are Claude-resident; Gemini reads them at L4 Discovery Layer but does not author."
last_verified_session: STEP_7_GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_IMPLEMENTATION
last_verified_on: 2026-04-24
notes: "Unified canonical L1 — all planet/house/lagna/saham/dasha data. Supersedes v6.0 and v7.0 supplement."
```

Unified canonical L1 — 1,950-line single-source-of-truth for every planet/house/lagna/saham/dasha fact. All L2+ claims cite `v6_ids_consumed` rooted here. FORENSIC fingerprint rotation requires a formal supplement or v9.0 event + FIX_SESSION mirror cascade to MSR/UCN/CDLM/RM/CGM. Not touched in Step 7.

#### LEL

```yaml
canonical_id: LEL
path: 01_FACTS_LAYER/LIFE_EVENT_LOG_v1_2.md
version: "1.2"
status: CURRENT
fingerprint_sha256: a8e5148a7b186d04378dc0eff1047305d87a68ba3c89e517b0af05014057b4b6
mirror_obligations:
  claude_side: 01_FACTS_LAYER/LIFE_EVENT_LOG_v1_2.md
  gemini_side: null
  mirror_mode: claude_only
  authoritative_side: claude
  asymmetries: "L1 facts are Claude-resident; Gemini reads them at L4 Discovery Layer but does not author."
last_verified_session: STEP_7_GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_IMPLEMENTATION
last_verified_on: 2026-04-24
notes: "36 events + 5 period summaries + 6 chronic patterns + Swiss-Ephemeris-populated chart_states. Confidence 0.89."
```

Life Event Log v1.2 is CURRENT. MP v2.0 names LEL as M4 prerequisite with cadence "Start immediately; do not defer." Closes GA.9 at the CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS registration layer; full CLAUDE.md surfacing lands at Step 9.

### L2.5 — Holistic Synthesis

### MP.4 — PHASE_B_PLAN_v1_0.md (v1.0.3) ↔ Gemini-side phase pointer

```yaml
pair_id: MP.4
claude_side: 00_ARCHITECTURE/PHASE_B_PLAN_v1_0.md
gemini_side: "current-phase pointer in .gemini/project_state.md + .geminirules item #4"
authoritative_side: claude
mirror_mode: adapted_parity_summary
enforcement_rule: >
  Compare:
  (a) PHASE_B_PLAN version pointer — Gemini side cites v1.0.3 matching PBP frontmatter;
  (b) pause-during-rebuild banner — Gemini side reflects the paused state while STEP_LEDGER
      is LIVE.
  FAIL on version disagreement.
  FAIL on absence of paused-state reflection on Gemini side during the rebuild era.
known_asymmetries:
  - "Gemini-side carries only the current-phase pointer; the full B.0–B.10 plan is Claude-only"
```

### MP.5 — FILE_REGISTRY ↔ Gemini-side L2.5 path block

```yaml
pair_id: MP.5
claude_side: 00_ARCHITECTURE/FILE_REGISTRY_v1_3.md
gemini_side: "L2.5 canonical-path block in .geminirules layer-architecture section"
authoritative_side: claude
mirror_mode: adapted_parity_subset
enforcement_rule: >
  Compare:
  The L2.5 path subset Gemini side carries (MSR_v3_0 / UCN_v4_0 / CDLM_v1_1 / CGM_v2_0 / RM_v2_0)
  matches FILE_REGISTRY §4.
  FAIL on path disagreement (e.g., Gemini side still citing MSR_v2_0 after a version bump).
  PASS if Gemini side is a proper subset with no contradictions.
known_asymmetries:
  - "Gemini-side carries only L2.5 paths relevant to L4 Discovery Layer; does not mirror FILE_REGISTRY's full inventory"
```

### MP.6 — GOVERNANCE_STACK (Claude-only)

```yaml
pair_id: MP.6
claude_side: 00_ARCHITECTURE/GOVERNANCE_STACK_v1_0.md
gemini_side: null
authoritative_side: claude
mirror_mode: claude_only
enforcement_rule: >
  No enforcement; the pair is declared Claude-only. mirror_enforcer.py emits a
  PASS_DECLARED_CLAUDE_ONLY entry in the report. Revisit if a Gemini-side governance surface
  emerges.
known_asymmetries: []
```

### MP.7 — SESSION_LOG (Claude-only)

```yaml
pair_id: MP.7
claude_side: 00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_LOG.md
gemini_side: null
authoritative_side: claude
mirror_mode: claude_only
enforcement_rule: >
  No enforcement; the pair is declared Claude-only per Step 5A decision. The session-pointer
  aspect is mirrored via MP.2 composite. mirror_enforcer.py emits PASS_DECLARED_CLAUDE_ONLY.
  Revisit if Gemini sessions begin producing their own session records.
known_asymmetries: []
```

### MP.8 — PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_2.md ↔ Gemini-side architecture summary

```yaml
pair_id: MP.8
claude_side: 00_ARCHITECTURE/PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_2.md
gemini_side: "compact architecture block in .geminirules + .gemini/project_state.md"
authoritative_side: claude
mirror_mode: adapted_parity_summary
enforcement_rule: >
  Compare:
  (a) architecture version pointer — Gemini side (.geminirules item #2 + .gemini/project_state.md
      canonical corpus state) cites `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_2.md`;
  (b) five-layer architecture summary — Gemini-side matches PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE §C by layer
      count (5) and by L0..L4 names;
  (c) mirror-pair inventory cite — Gemini side references `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_2.md §D.11.2`
      as the architecture-layer first pass, and this file (CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS) as the
      machine-enforceable inventory.
  FAIL on version disagreement.
  FAIL on layer-naming disagreement.
known_asymmetries:
  - "Gemini-side carries a compact architecture summary; full v2.2 text (1,180 lines) is Claude-only"
```

## §3 — Asymmetry declarations (aggregate)

Per ND.1 "Asymmetries to preserve (not defects)". Re-stated here aggregately for grep-friendliness; authoritative declarations live per-pair in §2 `known_asymmetries`. Drift between §2 and §3 is itself a finding (class `asymmetry_declaration_drift`).

- **MP.1** — Claude-only: Claude Code / MCP / skills references; CLAUDE.md's Collaboration-with-Gemini section is Claude-addressing. Gemini-only: `.geminirules` Gemini-rules idiom; Mirror-Discipline-Collaboration-with-Claude section is Gemini-addressing.
- **MP.2** — Claude-only: SESSION_LOG history (time-stamped entries). Gemini-side carries only current state.
- **MP.3** — Gemini-side compact summary only; full MP Claude-side.
- **MP.4** — Gemini-side current-phase pointer only; full B.0–B.10 Claude-side.
- **MP.5** — Gemini-side L2.5 subset only; full FILE_REGISTRY Claude-side. Subset relationship is the declared asymmetry.
- **MP.6**, **MP.7** — Declared Claude-only; no Gemini counterpart. No enforcement.
- **MP.8** — Gemini-side compact architecture summary only; full v2.2 text Claude-side.

## §4 — Future-agent admission protocol

Per `MACRO_PLAN_v2_0.md §3.4.E`: if a third agent is admitted (e.g., Gemini 3.0 alongside 2.5 Pro, or Opus 5.0 alongside 4.7), the admission session:

1. Adds new mirror-pair rows (MP.9+) to §2 with their own enforcement rules.
2. Extends `mirror_enforcer.py`'s rule set within the same session that introduces the pair.
3. Updates `FILE_REGISTRY` and `GOVERNANCE_STACK` per the protocol §D registry triad.
4. Bumps this file to v1.X for the additive change.

---

## §5 — Changelog reference

See frontmatter `changelog` field. Fingerprint rotations of individual rows do not bump the file's own version (they are per-row edits tracked in `last_verified_session` / `last_verified_on`). Schema-breaking changes (new required field, field removal) force a major bump to v2.0.
