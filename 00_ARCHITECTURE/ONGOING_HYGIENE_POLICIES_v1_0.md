role: >
  Institutionalized hygiene-rule set governing the MARSYS-JIS project's living governance
  surfaces. Prevents the kind of drift the grounding audit found (version disagreement,
  unarchived predecessors, scope leak, session-log gaps, stale canonical pointers) from
  re-accumulating between macro-phases. Each policy names the mechanism that enforces
  it: a validator check, a template field, a registry rule, or a documented human
  cadence. Referenced by every session-close checklist from Step 12 forward.
implements: >
  Step 12 brief §3 (§A–§J policy structure). Closes GA.12 (LEL v1.1 predecessor),
  GA.20 (scope-boundary enforcement at close-checklist layer; Step 7 closed at
  handshake layer), GA.21 (SESSION_LOG completeness). Extends Step 7 governance-
  integrity implementation by adding three schema_validator checks (scope_boundary,
  files_touched_completeness, learning_layer_stub) and closing Step 8 red-team
  findings F.1, F.2, F.3. Commits the per-mechanism Learning Layer N-override
  default (N=3, no override) per LEARNING_LAYER_SCAFFOLD_DECISION_v1_0 §5.4.
  References — does NOT duplicate — LIVING_PROJECT_MAINTENANCE_GUIDE_v1_0.md
  (CLOSED; corpus-refresh cadence) and MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULE_v1_0.md (CLOSED;
  concrete 36-month calendar). Those artifacts govern the corpus-subject layer
  (varshphal, LEL bump, HEATMAP); this artifact governs the governance-artifact
  layer.
supersedes: >
  (None — first version.) Previously, hygiene rules were scattered across
  GOVERNANCE_STACK amendment logs, LIVING_PROJECT_MAINTENANCE_GUIDE, the
  Step 7 governance-integrity protocol §C axes, and ad-hoc SESSION_LOG notes.
  This artifact consolidates the governance-layer rules into a single surface
  with explicit enforcement-mechanism mapping.

# ONGOING HYGIENE POLICIES v1.0
## MARSYS-JIS Project — Governance-Layer Hygiene Rule Set

*Produced in Step 12 of the Step 0 → Step 15 governance rebuild. Closes GA.12 + GA.20 + GA.21 and Step 8 red-team findings F.1 + F.2 + F.3. Reference point for every session-close checklist from this session forward.*

## §0 — How to read this artifact

Each policy section (§A–§J) carries four parts: **Policy** (the rule in prose), **Rationale** (what drift it prevents, citing GA.N / F.N / WARN.N where applicable), **Enforcement mechanism** (the script / template field / registry rule / documented human cadence that backs it), and **Failure mode** (what a violation looks like + what the enforcer does about it). §K records residual-finding disposition — every open finding at Step 12 open either closes here or is explicitly re-deferred with rationale, per brief §4's "no 'will revisit'" rule. §L is the finding-coverage audit table.

This file is governance-layer. Subject-layer corpus-refresh cadence (varshphal, LEL bump, HEATMAP refresh, dasha-transition deep-dives) is governed by `LIVING_PROJECT_MAINTENANCE_GUIDE_v1_0.md` (CLOSED 2026-04-18) and `MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULE_v1_0.md` (CLOSED 2026-04-18). Those artifacts are referenced, not duplicated. When a conflict arises between a governance-layer rule here and a corpus-layer rule there, the governance rule takes precedence for the governance surface and the corpus rule takes precedence for the corpus surface — they operate on disjoint sets.

The `MACRO_PLAN_v2_0.md §IS.8` red-team cadence and `GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL_v1_0.md §C.1–§C.6` six axes are the upstream substrate this artifact operationalizes. This artifact is not an alternative to them — it is the session-level operating layer that makes their axioms enforceable per-session.

---

## §A — Archival policy (SUPERSEDED artifacts)

### Policy

When a canonical artifact is version-bumped and its prior version becomes SUPERSEDED, the prior version **retains in place** at its original path with two surface changes:

1. A SUPERSEDED banner prepended as the first content line (above frontmatter body but not above the YAML fence): `> **SUPERSEDED <YYYY-MM-DD>** by `<successor-path>` at <session_id>. Content retained for audit trail; do not consume as CURRENT.`
2. Frontmatter `status` field flipped to `SUPERSEDED`; `superseded_by` field added pointing at the successor path; `superseded_on` date populated.

No move to an `archive/` subfolder. No deletion. The file remains grep-findable at its historical path so pointer-follow from old artifacts resolves cleanly in one hop (the banner routes the reader to the successor).

### Rationale

Moving SUPERSEDED files to `archive/` was considered but rejected. Every cross-reference in the corpus (from MACRO_PLAN_v1_0 → MP v2.0, MSR_v2_0 → v3.0, PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_1 → v2.2, FILE_REGISTRY_v1_0..v1_3 → v1.4, GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL DRAFT → CURRENT, etc.) was authored with the historical path. Moving the file breaks the pointer; rewriting every pointer breaks B.12 (no retroactive edits to closed artifacts). Retain-in-place with a banner preserves both the audit trail and the pointer graph. The current behavior — observed throughout Steps 1–11 — is hereby canonized as policy.

### Enforcement mechanism

- **Detective (automatic).** `drift_detector.py` already flags a file whose frontmatter reads `status: SUPERSEDED` but whose body lacks the `> **SUPERSEDED` banner, and vice versa. This existing check (introduced at Step 7) is the §A enforcement.
- **Preventive (human).** The session that performs a version bump writes both surface changes (banner + frontmatter flip) in the same tool call as the successor creation. The session's `files_touched` must include both the new CURRENT path AND the SUPERSEDED predecessor path.

### Failure mode

An orphan SUPERSEDED file (frontmatter SUPERSEDED, no banner, OR banner without frontmatter SUPERSEDED) fires `drift_detector.py` finding `supersession_banner_mismatch` at MEDIUM severity. The next session that touches the file resolves it; if none does, the quarterly governance pass (§H) catches it.

---

## §B — Predecessor cleanup (GA.12 closure)

### Policy

One-time cleanup action performed at Step 12 close: `01_FACTS_LAYER/LIFE_EVENT_LOG_v1_1.md` receives §A treatment (SUPERSEDED banner + frontmatter flip pointing at `LIFE_EVENT_LOG_v1_2.md`). This is the only predecessor in the corpus that lacks the banner at Step 12 open.

Standing rule: from Step 12 forward, every L1 / L2.5 / L3 / governance predecessor that has been version-bumped receives §A treatment in the same session as the bump. The quarterly governance pass (§H) scans for orphans.

### Rationale

GROUNDING_AUDIT_v1_0 §GA.12 (LOW, HYGIENE, owning_step=Step 11) named this file specifically. Step 11 deferred the cleanup to Step 12 per LL scaffold decision close notes. Resolving here closes GA.12 at the full-surface layer.

### Enforcement mechanism

- **One-time (this session).** The Step 12 close includes a SUPERSEDED banner + frontmatter flip on `LIFE_EVENT_LOG_v1_1.md` (pointing at `LIFE_EVENT_LOG_v1_2.md`).
- **Standing (forward).** §A enforcement applies. `drift_detector.py` scans for orphan-predecessor patterns at every session close.

### Failure mode

If the Step 12 close-checklist does not report `LIFE_EVENT_LOG_v1_1.md` in its `files_touched` list, Step 12 does not pass close. Forward: any L1/L2.5/L3/governance successor created without corresponding predecessor §A treatment fires `supersession_banner_mismatch` MEDIUM.

---

## §C — Scope-boundary enforcement (GA.20 full-surface closure)

### Policy

Every session's `session_close.files_touched` paths MUST each resolve to a `session_open.declared_scope.may_touch` glob, AND no path may resolve to `session_open.declared_scope.must_not_touch`. This is enforced at close — session cannot close if violated.

Scope declaration at open (already required per `SESSION_OPEN_TEMPLATE_v1_0.md §2`) is insufficient alone: a session could declare scope and then edit outside it. The close-checklist check is the complement that GA.20 requires.

### Rationale

Step 7 (governance integrity implementation) closed GA.20 at the handshake layer: sessions must declare scope at open, including a non-empty `must_not_touch`. GROUNDING_AUDIT_v1_0 §GA.20 explicitly names Step 7 AND Step 12 as owning steps — Step 7 addresses the declaration, Step 12 addresses the compliance check. This policy closes GA.20 at the compliance layer.

### Enforcement mechanism

- `platform/scripts/governance/schema_validator.py` gains a new check function `validate_scope_boundary(session_close, session_open)`:
  - For each path in `files_touched`:
    - Check membership in `declared_scope.may_touch` (glob match against each entry).
    - Check non-membership in `declared_scope.must_not_touch`.
  - Emit finding `scope_boundary_violation` at HIGH severity for each path that fails either check.
- Registered in `schemas/artifact_schemas.yaml` under the existing `session_close` class.
- Fires at every `schema_validator.py --session-close` invocation from Step 12 forward.

### Failure mode

A session that edits outside its declared scope fires `scope_boundary_violation` HIGH. The session cannot close. Remediation options: (a) amend `declared_scope` in a same-session directive-documented expansion and re-run the validator; (b) revert the out-of-scope edit; (c) halt and report to the native per GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL §K disagreement protocol if the out-of-scope edit is load-bearing.

---

## §D — SESSION_LOG completeness (GA.21 closure)

### Policy

The `session_close.files_touched` list MUST equal the set of files whose fingerprints changed during the session window. Specifically: for every canonical artifact in `CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS_v1_0.md §1`, the observed fingerprint at session close is compared to the declared fingerprint at session open. Any artifact whose fingerprint rotated must appear in `files_touched`; any `files_touched` entry must have a rotated fingerprint or a documented why-no-rotation reason (e.g., file created this session has no prior fingerprint).

### Rationale

GROUNDING_AUDIT_v1_0 §GA.21 (LOW, SCOPE-CREEP, owning_step=Step 12): "No automated check that every artifact touched in a session has a corresponding SESSION_LOG entry. An artifact can be edited without its session being logged." Closes here.

### Enforcement mechanism

- `schema_validator.py` gains `validate_files_touched_completeness(session_close, canonical_artifacts)`:
  - Compute the fingerprint-delta set: `{canonical_id : declared_fp != observed_fp}`.
  - Compute the files_touched set: `{path : path in session_close.files_touched}`.
  - For each entry in the fingerprint-delta set, resolve its canonical_id's path and check membership in files_touched. Missing → finding `files_touched_incomplete` HIGH.
  - For each entry in files_touched, either (a) the path's fingerprint rotated this session, or (b) the path's `files_touched[i].reason` field reads `created_this_session` / `reviewed_not_modified` / `status_flag_only`. Neither → finding `files_touched_unjustified` MEDIUM.
- Registered in `schemas/artifact_schemas.yaml`.

### Failure mode

A session that modifies a canonical artifact without declaring it in files_touched fires `files_touched_incomplete` HIGH. Session cannot close. Remediation: amend files_touched to include the missing path + rerun the validator.

---

## §E — Staleness Register (30-day + fingerprint-delta)

### Policy

A CURRENT canonical artifact is **STALE-SUSPECT** when BOTH:
1. Its `last_verified_on` (per CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS §1) is more than 30 days ago, AND
2. At least one of its cited canonical artifacts (transitively) has a rotated fingerprint since that `last_verified_on` date.

The 30-day threshold aligns with MACRO_PLAN_v2_0 §IS.8 red-team cadence's "every 12 months for MP itself" lower bound — a governance artifact untouched for more than 30 days in a daily-cadence project is suspect. Fingerprint-delta is the binary flip condition: stale-by-calendar alone is only a warning; stale-by-calendar + transitive-dependency-rotated is the finding.

### Rationale

Axis C.5 of the governance integrity protocol (Living-Document Hygiene) requires staleness detection. This policy gives the detection its concrete thresholds.

### Enforcement mechanism

- `drift_detector.py` already computes fingerprint-delta across CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS (Step 7 implementation). This policy adds the 30-day + transitive-dependency-rotated composite rule as a new finding class `stale_suspect_canonical` at MEDIUM severity.
- Registered as a documented detector behavior — no new code path if `drift_detector.py --full` already walks the canonical graph. If not, the code addition is one predicate in the existing canonical-walk loop. (Step 13 drift-detection baseline run will confirm the extension shape.)
- Quarterly governance pass (§H) materializes the Staleness Register as a dated report.

### Failure mode

`stale_suspect_canonical` MEDIUM fires. The next session that opens the project is prompted at handshake to acknowledge the stale artifact and schedule a refresh. No session close-blocker — staleness is a watch, not a stop.

---

## §F — CI / cron cadence

### Policy

The three governance scripts (`drift_detector.py`, `schema_validator.py`, `mirror_enforcer.py`) MUST run on every session close. This is already mandated by `SESSION_CLOSE_TEMPLATE_v1_0.md §2` (`drift_detector_run`, `schema_validator_run`, `mirror_enforcer_run` fields). This policy confirms the per-session cadence is the operational floor.

**Nightly automation is out of scope** for this environment. The MARSYS-JIS project runs as a daily-cadence human-in-the-loop workflow; there is no CI runner, no cron service, no persistent automation host at the time of this policy commit. The per-session cadence is sufficient because closed-artifact-per-session discipline (§M CLAUDE.md) ensures there is no between-session edit activity to detect.

If a persistent automation host is introduced in a future phase, the nightly cadence becomes: `drift_detector.py --full` + `schema_validator.py --full-repo` + `mirror_enforcer.py --all-pairs` at 02:00 local, with reports persisted under `00_ARCHITECTURE/drift_reports/nightly/`. Introduction of the nightly cadence is a Macro-Plan review trigger (§I) per "non-trivial mechanism addition" category.

**Exit-code policy (close-checklist extension).** Step 8 red-team finding F.2 noted that the current close-checklist fails on any nonzero exit code from the three scripts, but exit code 3 (MEDIUM/LOW findings only) is the normal baseline when `drift_detector.py` reports pre-existing whitelisted MEDIUM/LOW drift. This policy amends the close-checklist validation: exit code 3 passes close IF AND ONLY IF accompanied by a `known_residuals` block in the close YAML that enumerates every MEDIUM/LOW finding with a booking reference (step/date/rationale). Exit codes 1, 2, and 4+ always fail close.

### Rationale

Axis C.5 of the protocol mandates script execution at every session close. F.2 from Step 8 red-team documents the exit-code-3 policy gap. Both close here.

### Enforcement mechanism

- `SESSION_CLOSE_TEMPLATE_v1_0.md` (already active): three `*_run` fields are mandatory close-checklist items.
- `schema_validator.py` close-checklist validation: exit-code-3 whitelist rule added — pass IF `known_residuals` block present AND every listed finding is MEDIUM or LOW AND each carries a booking reference (step_id + rationale).
- Documented human cadence: no nightly automation; per-session cadence is the operational floor.

### Failure mode

Exit code 1/2/4+ in any script run → close fails, session halts. Exit code 3 without `known_residuals` block → close fails with `close_checklist_known_residuals_missing` HIGH. Exit code 3 with `known_residuals` block containing a HIGH/CRITICAL entry → close fails with `close_checklist_residual_severity_violation` HIGH.

---

## §G — Red-team cadence + learning_layer_stub validator class

### Policy (red-team cadence)

Per `MACRO_PLAN_v2_0.md §IS.8`, red-team passes fire at three cadences:

1. **Every 3rd session by default** (counter resets at each step-bound red-team AND at each macro-phase close).
2. **Every macro-phase close** before the SESSION_LOG seal (the red-team is a close-blocker, not a post-close cleanup).
3. **Every 12 months for MP itself** regardless of phase state.

Red-team sessions are a first-class session class per `SESSION_LOG_SCHEMA_v1_0.md §1`. Their SESSION_LOG entries carry a `red_team_verdict` field (one of: `PASS | PASS_WITH_FIXES | FAIL`) and a `findings_log_path` field pointing at the red-team artifact (e.g., `GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_REDTEAM_v1_0.md`).

The session-open handshake's `red_team_due` field makes the cadence machine-checkable: when `true`, the session either is a red-team session OR the handshake fails. The counter is maintained in `CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md` (added as a field at Step 12 close) and incremented at every session close.

### Policy (learning_layer_stub validator class per LL scaffold §5.7)

Per `LEARNING_LAYER_SCAFFOLD_DECISION_v1_0.md §5.7`, Step 12 commits a `learning_layer_stub` validator class to `schemas/artifact_schemas.yaml`. The class governs the four LL.1–LL.4 mechanism stub READMEs under `06_LEARNING_LAYER/`. Its rules:

1. **STATUS-banner regex.** The first non-frontmatter line of each stub README must match `^STATUS:\s*(STUB|ACTIVE)\s*(—|-)\s*.*$`. Exact form: `STATUS: STUB — activates at M4` (or equivalent for the mechanism).
2. **Population gate.** If the STATUS banner reads `ACTIVE`, the frontmatter must contain a non-null `activation_session_id` field pointing at a SESSION_LOG entry AND either a non-null `activation_lel_entry` (pointing at a LEL v1.X event ID) OR a non-null `activation_ppl_entry` (pointing at a PPL prediction ID). This enforces the two-pass population-gate rule from LL scaffold §5.2 (a mechanism cannot be marked ACTIVE without a matching LEL or PPL record).
3. **Classical-priors-locked guard.** The frontmatter's `writes_to` field, if present, must be a subset of `06_LEARNING_LAYER/**` globs. Any write-target outside `06_LEARNING_LAYER/` fails the check — this enforces LL scaffold §5.5 (learning modulates; never overwrites the classical-prior corpus).

### Policy (per-mechanism LL N-override default)

Per `LEARNING_LAYER_SCAFFOLD_DECISION_v1_0.md §5.4` explicit deferral to Step 12: the per-mechanism N-override value is **N=3 per mechanism, no override**. Binding from Step 12 close forward. A mechanism's activation session (at M4 for LL.1–LL.4; at M5–M10 for LL.5–LL.10) MAY propose a different N via a §LL-Appendix.B amendment to MACRO_PLAN, which is itself a Macro-Plan review trigger (§I).

### Rationale

`MACRO_PLAN_v2_0.md §"Learning discipline rule #3"` deferred per-mechanism N-override to "Step 11 scaffold or the mechanism's activation phase, whichever comes first." LL_SCAFFOLD §5.4 exercised the "whichever comes first" clause by deferring to Step 12. Committing N=3 default now gives the mechanism stubs a concrete baseline without pre-building M4+ operational parameters.

### Enforcement mechanism

- **Red-team cadence.** Session-open handshake `red_team_due` field + CURRENT_STATE `red_team_counter` field (added at Step 12). Counter increment at every close.
- **learning_layer_stub class.** Registered in `schemas/artifact_schemas.yaml`. Validated by `schema_validator.py` at every session that touches a file under `06_LEARNING_LAYER/`.
- **LL N=3 default.** Documented in this policy; LL mechanism stubs at `06_LEARNING_LAYER/{LL.1,LL.2,LL.3,LL.4}/README.md` cite this policy + the N=3 value in their frontmatter (existing stubs carry N=3 already per LL scaffold §5.4).

### Failure mode

- Red-team due but session is not a red-team session → handshake fails with `red_team_cadence_violation` HIGH.
- Stub README missing STATUS banner → `learning_layer_stub_banner_missing` HIGH.
- STATUS ACTIVE without `activation_lel_entry` or `activation_ppl_entry` → `learning_layer_population_gate_violation` HIGH. Session cannot close until one is populated.
- `writes_to` points outside `06_LEARNING_LAYER/**` → `classical_priors_locked_violation` CRITICAL. Session cannot close.

---

## §H — Quarterly governance pass

### Policy

Every calendar quarter (first week of January, April, July, October), the project runs a **governance delta audit**: a fresh read of every canonical artifact + a diff against the prior quarter's grounding-audit baseline. Deliverable: `GROUNDING_AUDIT_v1_<next-minor>.md` (delta-only; does not re-audit unchanged artifacts). The baseline for Q2 2026 is the current `GROUNDING_AUDIT_v1_0.md` (dated 2026-04-23).

First quarterly pass scheduled: **2026-07-01** (Q3 2026 audit). Subsequent passes: 2026-10-01, 2027-01-01, 2027-04-01, etc.

The quarterly pass is distinct from the §G red-team cadence. Red-team is adversarial (tests injections); governance pass is confirmatory (scans for drift). Both run at macro-phase close (§G rule 2 + §H quarterly).

### Rationale

Prevents slow creep: the per-session drift_detector catches single-session deltas, but a cumulative drift pattern across 20 sessions may slip below per-session thresholds. Quarterly full-surface audit catches the cumulative pattern.

### Enforcement mechanism

- Documented human cadence entered into `MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULE_v1_0.md`'s calendar — NOT here. Cross-reference only: this policy binds the cadence; MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULE carries the date list. (MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULE is CLOSED; the cross-reference entry lives in a new §N.1 appendix to be added during post-Step-15 ongoing operations — booked in §K residuals as non-blocking.)
- `drift_detector.py --full` + `schema_validator.py --full-repo` + `mirror_enforcer.py --all-pairs` are the tool-level invocations.
- The pass produces `GROUNDING_AUDIT_v1_<N>.md` as a minor-version bump successor to v1.0. Fingerprint-delta report attached as appendix.

### Failure mode

Missed quarterly pass → `quarterly_governance_pass_missed` LOW at the next session's handshake. Not a close-blocker — the pass is caught up at the next session. Persistent skip (2+ quarters) escalates to MEDIUM via §I Macro-Plan review trigger.

---

## §I — Macro Plan review triggers

### Policy

`MACRO_PLAN_v2_0.md` is version-bumped when any of the following triggers fires:

1. **Non-trivial mechanism addition** — a new L2.5 synthesis mechanism, a new L3 domain report class, a new L4 discovery pattern, a new Learning Layer mechanism (LL.11+), a new System Integrity Substrate axis (IS.10+), or a new Ethical Framework tier.
2. **Macro-phase redefinition** — scope change to any of M1–M10, addition of an M11+, or merger/split of existing macro-phases.
3. **External constraint change** — new classical text corpus acquired (e.g., a new Nadi branch); new agent class integrated (per MP §3.4.E third-agent admission protocol); ethical-framework policy change from the native.
4. **Finding cluster** — ≥3 cumulative HIGH findings against MP v2.0 from quarterly governance passes (§H) without resolution.
5. **Red-team FAIL verdict** — any red-team session whose verdict is FAIL against MP content.

Each trigger forces a minor-version bump (v2.0 → v2.1) at minimum. Multi-trigger events or architectural-level changes force a major bump (v2.0 → v3.0) with native approval.

### Explicit re-defer of WARN.2 / WARN.5 / WARN.7 (from Step 5 / Step 5A)

Three drift warnings remain open from earlier rebuild steps that are **explicitly out of scope for Step 12 and are not silent deferrals**:

- **WARN.2** — `PHASE_B_PLAN_v1_0.md §5` header + `§N.10` live MP v1.0 pointers.
- **WARN.5** — `B0_KICKOFF_PROMPT_FOR_CLAUDE_CODE.md` line 20 live MP v1.0 pointer.
- **WARN.7** — `025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/CLAUDE.md` line 3 live `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_1 §C.3 / §H.4` pointer.

**Disposition.** All three are scheduled for resolution at the `PHASE_B_PLAN_v1_0.md v1.0.3` amendment cycle that fires naturally when M2 execution resumes post-Step-15 close. Rationale for non-inclusion at Step 12:
- PHASE_B_PLAN is a separately-authored artifact (canonical_id `PHASE_B_PLAN`, path `00_ARCHITECTURE/PHASE_B_PLAN_v1_0.md`, authoritative_side claude); its amendment cycle is governed by the B-plan itself, not by a governance-hygiene step.
- The 025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/CLAUDE.md subfolder helper is a B-plan-phase-specific reading surface activated at M2 B-phase resume; touching it at Step 12 would pre-build for a later phase (forbidden by MACRO_PLAN §Scope Boundary).
- The v1.0 SUPERSEDED banners on `MACRO_PLAN_v1_0.md` and `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_1.md` already route any reader of these three live pointers to the CURRENT version in one hop, per §A archival policy. No functional hazard persists between Step 12 close and PHASE_B_PLAN v1.0.3 amendment-cycle fire.

This re-defer is not "will revisit" language — it is a scheduled amendment with a named owner (the PHASE_B_PLAN v1.0.3 cycle) and a named trigger (M2 resume post-Step-15). It meets brief §4's "explicitly out of scope with rationale" standard.

### Rationale

§2 of MACRO_PLAN_v2_0 defines the ten-macro-phase arc; §IS-level additions are architectural, not incremental. Explicit trigger enumeration prevents silent MP mutation.

### Enforcement mechanism

- Human trigger recognition + version bump per `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_2.md §B.8` versioning discipline.
- `drift_detector.py` scans MACRO_PLAN_v2_0 frontmatter `changelog` against CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS §1 version; mismatch fires `macro_plan_version_mismatch` HIGH.

### Failure mode

Silent MP mutation (content change without version bump) fires `macro_plan_version_mismatch` HIGH at the next session's handshake. Unrecognized trigger (e.g., a new mechanism landed without MP bump) catches at the next quarterly governance pass via §H.

| §C Scope-boundary close-check | New validator function | `schema_validator.py::validate_scope_boundary` + `schemas/artifact_schemas.yaml::session_close.scope_boundary` |
| §D SESSION_LOG completeness | New validator function | `schema_validator.py::validate_files_touched_completeness` + schema entry |
| §E Staleness Register | Existing detector + new finding class | `drift_detector.py` canonical-walk + `stale_suspect_canonical` finding |
| §F CI cadence + exit-3 whitelist | Template field (existing) + new validator rule | `SESSION_CLOSE_TEMPLATE §2` + `schema_validator.py` close-checklist exit-code rule |

| §I MP review triggers + WARN re-defer | Documented trigger list + existing detector | MACRO_PLAN §Scope Boundary + `macro_plan_version_mismatch` check |

Additional implementation actions required by Step 12 close (not in §A–§I but in the brief's close-criteria list):

| Action | Target | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| F.1 mirror-structural-block check | `schema_validator.py::validate_mirror_structural_block` | Closes Step 8 red-team F.1 (coarse mirror substring match) |
| F.2 close-checklist exit-3 policy | §F policy | Closes F.2 |
| F.3 `--dr-entry` validator subcommand | `schema_validator.py` CLI | Closes F.3 (no single-entry DR validator mode) |

## §K — Residual-finding disposition (Step 12 close record)

Per brief §4 "do not defer with 'will revisit'" — every residual as of Step 12 open either closes here or re-defers with explicit rationale + named owner + named trigger.

| ID | Description | Severity | Disposition | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **GA.12** | LEL v1.1 predecessor unarchived | LOW | **CLOSED** | §B action |
| **GA.20** | Scope-boundary enforcement | MEDIUM | **CLOSED at full-surface layer** | §C validator (Step 7 closed handshake layer; Step 12 closes close-checklist layer) |
| **GA.21** | SESSION_LOG completeness | LOW | **CLOSED** | §D validator |
| **F.1** | Mirror substring-presence gap | WARN | **CLOSED** | `validate_mirror_structural_block` extension |
| **F.2** | Close-checklist exit-3 policy gap | WARN | **CLOSED** | §F exit-code whitelist rule |
| **F.3** | No `--dr-entry` validator mode | WARN | **CLOSED** | New CLI subcommand |
| **WARN.2** | PHASE_B_PLAN §5 + §N.10 live MP v1.0 pointers | WARN | **RE-DEFERRED** to PHASE_B_PLAN v1.0.3 amendment cycle | §I rationale; trigger: M2 resume post-Step-15 |
| **WARN.5** | B0_KICKOFF_PROMPT MP v1.0 pointer | WARN | **RE-DEFERRED** to PHASE_B_PLAN v1.0.3 amendment cycle | §I rationale; same trigger as WARN.2 |
| **WARN.7** | 025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/CLAUDE.md v2.1 pointer | WARN | **RE-DEFERRED** to PHASE_B_PLAN v1.0.3 amendment cycle | §I rationale; subfolder helper activated at M2 B-phase resume |
| **WARN.3** | MP CW.PPL scaffold-anchor language harmonization | WARN | **RE-DEFERRED** to next MP minor-version bump | Low-priority phrasing nit; no functional hazard |
| **WARN.4** | BOOTSTRAP v2.1 pointer | WARN | **CLOSED** | Step 12 retires BOOTSTRAP with SUPERSEDED banner per native decision 2026-04-24 |
| **WARN.6** | subfolder 00_ARCHITECTURE/CLAUDE.md v2.1 pointer | WARN | **CLOSED** | Same retirement action as WARN.4 (subfolder CLAUDE.md stops being referenced from master CLAUDE.md §C #11; becomes orphan and is SUPERSEDED-bannered in the same pass) |
| **FILE_REGISTRY v1.3→v1.4 bump** | Step 10-deferred minor bump | — | **PERFORMED this session** | §K of FILE_REGISTRY_v1_4 changelog |
| **GOVERNANCE_STACK cumulative-log consolidation** | Step 9/10/11-deferred consolidation | — | **PERFORMED this session** | §13 STEP_12 amendment + cumulative-log index |
| **CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS self-row fingerprint** | Step 7 "populated-at-step-7-close" placeholder | — | **RESOLVED this session** | Self-row fingerprint computed + written at Step 12 close |
| **LL N-override default** | LL scaffold §5.4 deferral to Step 12 | — | **COMMITTED** | §G: N=3 per mechanism, no override |
| **GA.6, GA.17, GA.18, GA.19** | Learning Layer / SESSION_LOG naming / menu / you-are-here | — | **already closed at Steps 10/11** | Reference only; no Step 12 action |

## §L — Finding-coverage audit table

Comprehensive audit of every finding class relevant to Step 12's scope. Each row either closes at Step 12 or is explicitly re-deferred.

| Class | Count at Step 12 open | Closed at Step 12 | Re-deferred | Remaining |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GA.N (GROUNDING_AUDIT) | 3 named for Step 12 (GA.12/20/21) | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| F.N (Step 8 red-team) | 3 (F.1/F.2/F.3) | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| WARN.N (pre-existing) | 7 (WARN.1–7; WARN.1 closed Step 11; WARN.3 low-priority re-defer) | 2 (WARN.4, WARN.6) | 4 (WARN.2, WARN.3, WARN.5, WARN.7) | 0 (all have named owner+trigger) |
| Deferred items (Step 7/8/9/10/11 carried) | 4 (FILE_REGISTRY bump, GOVERNANCE_STACK consolidation, CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS self-row, LL N=3) | 4 | 0 | 0 |

Total findings closed at Step 12: **12**. Total findings re-deferred with explicit rationale + owner + trigger: **4**. No silent deferrals. No "will revisit" language.

## §M — Interactions with other governance surfaces

- **`GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL_v1_0.md`** — §C axes remain the upstream definition; this artifact is the operating-level realization of §C.4 (scope) + §C.5 (hygiene) + §C.6 (multi-agent via §G red-team cadence).
- **`LIVING_PROJECT_MAINTENANCE_GUIDE_v1_0.md`** (CLOSED, 2026-04-18) — corpus-layer maintenance. Referenced, not duplicated. Disjoint scope: this artifact governs `00_ARCHITECTURE/**` + `platform/scripts/governance/**`; LPMG governs `01_FACTS_LAYER/**` + `025_HOLISTIC_SYNTHESIS/**` + `03_DOMAIN_REPORTS/**` refresh.
- **`MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULE_v1_0.md`** (CLOSED, 2026-04-18) — concrete calendar. Referenced by §H for quarterly-pass dates (cross-reference entry to be added at post-Step-15 hygiene pass).
- **`SESSION_LOG_SCHEMA_v1_0.md`** (Step 10) — entry-structure schema. §G red-team cadence consumes `session_class` values from SLS §1.
- **`LEARNING_LAYER_SCAFFOLD_DECISION_v1_0.md`** (Step 11) — §5.4 (N-override deferral) and §5.7 (learning_layer_stub validator class) are the source of §G's Learning Layer commitments.
