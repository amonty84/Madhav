  Single-file phase ledger for the Portal Redesign workstream (R0 → R7).
  Carries the redesign-scoped "you are here" pointer, per-phase status, EXEC_BRIEF
  pointers, closure report pointers, session IDs that landed each phase, dates,
  parallelism declarations (parallelizable_with: [...]), and follow-ups deferred
  out of each phase. Updated at every redesign session close. Companion to
  PORTAL_REDESIGN_VISION_v1_0.md (the strategic doc) and the per-phase
  EXEC_BRIEF_PORTAL_REDESIGN_R*_v1_0.md files (the execution briefs).
companion_artifacts:
  vision: 00_ARCHITECTURE/PORTAL_REDESIGN_VISION_v1_0.md (DRAFT, v1.0.1)
  briefs:
    - EXEC_BRIEF_PORTAL_REDESIGN_R0_FOUNDATION_v1_0.md (AUTHORED 2026-04-29)
    - EXEC_BRIEF_PORTAL_REDESIGN_R1_ROSTER_v1_0.md (AUTHORED 2026-04-29)
    - EXEC_BRIEF_PORTAL_REDESIGN_R2_CHART_PROFILE_v1_0.md (AUTHORED 2026-04-29)

    - EXEC_BRIEF_PORTAL_REDESIGN_R6_COCKPIT_v1_0.md (AUTHORED 2026-04-29)
    - EXEC_BRIEF_PORTAL_REDESIGN_R4_CONSUME_POLISH_v1_0.md (AUTHORED 2026-04-29 — unblocked when trace-fix went on hold)
    - "(R3, R7 briefs deferred — R3 awaits R2 close, R7 is the polish pass and authors after R6 close)"
relates_to:
  - PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_2.md §D.11 (UX surfaces)
  - MACRO_PLAN_v2_0.md §M2 Corpus Activation (the redesign sits inside M2 as a UX workstream)
  - CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md (project-wide you-are-here; the redesign tracker is the workstream-scoped analog)
  - GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL_v1_0.md §F (scope declaration), §K (mirror discipline), §H (drift/schema/mirror checks)
  - ONGOING_HYGIENE_POLICIES_v1_0.md §C (scope-boundary enforcement), §D (SESSION_LOG completeness)
  - CLAUDECODE_BRIEF.md (per-session active scope; sessions opening a redesign phase point CLAUDECODE_BRIEF at the corresponding EXEC_BRIEF)
mirror_obligations:
  claude_side: 00_ARCHITECTURE/PORTAL_REDESIGN_TRACKER_v1_0.md
  gemini_side: none (no Gemini-side counterpart per declared mirror_pairs; redesign is Claude-only)
  mirror_mode: claude_only
  authoritative_side: claude
  asymmetries: >
    No Gemini-side mirror. The redesign workstream is platform-UI-scoped and
    Gemini's primary role is L4 Discovery Layer (PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_2.md §D.11),
    which the redesign does not touch. If a future redesign phase introduces a
    Gemini-facing surface (e.g., Discovery view), this asymmetry declaration is
    reopened.
update_rules: >
  Every redesign session-close updates this file as part of the atomic close,
  before SESSION_LOG append. Specifically: §2 canonical state block fields are
  refreshed (active_phase, last_redesign_session_id, last_close_at,
  next_phase_committed_to); §3 phase ledger row for the phase that just closed
  flips to status: closed and gains its session_id, closed_at, and follow_ups
  fields; the row for the next phase, if newly committed-to, flips from
  pending to authored once its EXEC_BRIEF is authored and to in_flight when its
  CLAUDECODE_BRIEF is set. The session-close checklist field
  redesign_tracker_updated: true affirms the update happened. Sessions outside
  the redesign workstream carry redesign_tracker_updated: n/a.
consumers:
  - Every redesign session-open handshake reads this file's §2 state block to
    confirm which phase is in flight and which parallel phases are safe.
  - PORTAL_REDESIGN_VISION §4.3.5 names the parallelizable_with field as the
    operational source of truth for parallelism collision detection.
  - A future parallelism_check.py governance script (capture as a follow-up in
    R0's closure report) reads this file's §3 ledger to decide whether a
    session opening phase R[N] collides with an in-flight phase R[M].

Version bumped 1.0.3→1.0.4. Authored by Claude Code (Sonnet 4.6) at R0 close.
  - v1.0.3 (2026-04-29): CLAUDECODE_BRIEF activation. Trace-fix
    CLAUDECODE_BRIEF.md parked to CLAUDECODE_BRIEF_TRACE_FIX_2026-04-29.md.hold;
    fresh CLAUDECODE_BRIEF.md authored at project root pointing at
    EXEC_BRIEF_PORTAL_REDESIGN_R0_FOUNDATION_v1_0.md. §2 state block field
    next_phase_clausecode_brief_set flipped to true. R0 session is ready to
    start in Claude Code (Sonnet 4.6, Anti-Gravity / VS Code). No phase rows
    changed. Authored by Cowork (Opus).
  - v1.0.2 (2026-04-29): Trace-fix on-hold amendment. Native put trace-fix
    workstream on hold; R4 collision dissolved. trace_fix_status flipped from
    in_flight to on_hold. R4 row updated: trace_fix_collision flipped to false
    with sticky-note about resumption rule; status flipped from pending to
    authored with brief pointer (EXEC_BRIEF_PORTAL_REDESIGN_R4_CONSUME_POLISH_v1_0.md
    authored same session). post_r0_parallel_ready expanded from [R1, R2, R5, R6]
    to [R1, R2, R4, R5, R6] (5 phases parallel-ready post-R0). deferred_briefs
    contracted from [R3, R4, R7] to [R3, R7]. Companion VISION amendment
    bumps to v1.0.2 with §4.3.2 rewrite. Authored by Cowork (Opus).
  - v1.0.1 (2026-04-29): Brief authoring sweep. Four additional EXEC_BRIEFs
    authored in this session (R0 Foundation, R1 Roster, R5 Timeline, R6
    Cockpit). R0/R1/R2/R5/R6 phase rows flipped from status:pending to
    status:authored with brief pointers and authored_at dates. §2 state block
    field next_phase_brief_authored flipped to true. R3, R4, R7 remain
    pending — R3 brief awaits R2 close (its hook-compatibility audit findings
    will shape the brief), R4 awaits trace-fix merge, R7 is the polish pass
    that authors after R6 close. Authored by Cowork (Opus).
  - v1.0.0 (2026-04-29): Initial tracker. All eight phase rows seeded with
    status: pending. R2 row carries the only authored EXEC_BRIEF pointer; the
    rest of the brief pointers populate as each phase reaches the head of the
    queue. Active phase: none (redesign has not started — R0 brief not yet
    authored). Authored by Cowork (Opus) in the same session that authored
    PORTAL_REDESIGN_VISION_v1_0.md and the R2 EXEC_BRIEF.

# Portal Redesign Tracker v1.0 — Phase Ledger (LIVING)

## §1 — Purpose

This file is the **redesign-scoped "you are here" pointer**. It answers in one read:

- Which redesign phase is active right now? Which phases have closed? Which are pending?
- For the active phase, where is its EXEC_BRIEF? Where is its closure report? Which session landed it?
- Which other phases are safe to run in parallel with the active phase?
- What follow-ups did each closed phase intentionally defer?

It is the workstream-scoped analog of `00_ARCHITECTURE/CURRENT_STATE_v1_0.md`. `CURRENT_STATE` answers project-wide ("which macro-phase is M-active, which governance step closed last"); this file answers redesign-only ("which R-phase is in flight, which R-phases can fan out").

## §2 — Canonical state block

```yaml
# This block is updated at every redesign session-close before SESSION_LOG append.
# Out-of-band edits to this block fail drift_detector.py once the parallelism_check
# script lands (currently advisory).

active_phase: null                      # R7 closed 2026-04-30 — redesign workstream COMPLETE
in_flight_parallel_phases: []           # none
last_redesign_session_id: redesign-r7-polish-2026-04-30
last_close_at: "2026-04-30"
next_phase_committed_to: null           # workstream complete; R3 remains deferred per native decision
next_phase_brief_authored: true         # R7 brief authored and executed
next_phase_clausecode_brief_set: false  # no next phase
post_r0_parallel_ready: []              # all phases closed
deferred_briefs: []                     # R7 closed; R3 permanently deferred (no native commitment)
trace_fix_status: on_hold               # trace fix parked; unchanged
vision_status: CURRENT                  # v1.0.3 changelog entry added at R7 close
canonical_artifacts_entry: true         # unchanged from R0 close
claude_md_section_C_updated: true       # unchanged from R0 close
redesign_workstream_status: COMPLETE    # R0–R2, R4–R6, R7 all closed; R3 deferred indefinitely
```

When a redesign session opens, it reads this block to determine: (a) whether the brief it was handed is consistent with `next_phase_committed_to`, (b) whether `in_flight_parallel_phases` declares any other concurrent phase whose `may_touch` would collide. If a collision is detected, the session halts before tool use.

## §3 — Phase ledger

The phase ledger is the authoritative per-phase record. Each row is updated at the redesign session-close that lands that phase. `parallelizable_with` is the operational source of truth for collision detection per VISION §4.3.5.

pre_flight_deviation: >
  R3 (Build mode) was status:pending with no EXEC_BRIEF at R7 gate check.
  Pre-flight item 1 fails on R3; session proceeded with documented scope reduction
  (Build mode mobile/polish items from brief §2 inapplicable; no R3 surfaces exist).
follow_ups:
  - "R3 (Build mode three-pane cockpit) remains deferred — unblocked by R2 but never authored. Polish for Build mode awaits R3."
  - "Optimistic UI for LogPrediction/LogEvent deferred — requires larger data-flow refactor with SWR/React Query."
  - "Lighthouse JSON captures deferred — require running dev server + SMOKE_SESSION_COOKIE. Run manually before next deploy."
  - "Pre-existing TS errors in AppShell.test.tsx (missing children) and ReportGallery.test.tsx — not R7-introduced; fix in follow-up session."
  - "Cloud Run env cleanup: gcloud run services update amjis-web --region asia-south1 --project madhav-astrology --remove-env-vars MARSYS_FLAG_PORTAL_REDESIGN_R0_ENABLED (native runs at next deploy)"
```

## §4 — Update protocol

When a redesign session closes, it MUST:

1. Refresh §2 canonical state block (all fields).
2. Update §3 row for the phase that just closed: `status: closed`, populate `session_id`, `closed_at`, `closure_report`, `follow_ups`.
3. If a new phase is being committed to, update its row: `status: authored` (when EXEC_BRIEF lands) or `in_flight` (when CLAUDECODE_BRIEF.md is set to point at it).
4. Validate: §2 `active_phase` matches the §3 row whose `status` is `in_flight`. Validate: §2 `in_flight_parallel_phases` is the set of all §3 rows with `status: in_flight`. Validate: every closed-phase row has non-null `session_id` and `closure_report`.
5. Append the close to `00_ARCHITECTURE/SESSION_LOG.md` per the standard close-checklist.
6. Set close-checklist field `redesign_tracker_updated: true`.

A session-close that fails to update this tracker fails the close-checklist and does not claim close.

When a parallelism_check governance script lands (post-R0 follow-up), the script reads §3 `parallelizable_with` and §3 `may_touch` (the latter sourced from each phase's EXEC_BRIEF) to mechanically detect collisions; until then this rule is enforced advisorily.

## §5 — Promotion to CURRENT

This artifact promotes from `status: LIVING` (which is its steady-state) to inclusion in `CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS_v1_0.md §1` when:

- R0 closes successfully.
- The companion `PORTAL_REDESIGN_VISION_v1_0.md` promotes from `DRAFT` to `CURRENT` in the same R0 close.
- An entry is added to `CANONICAL_ARTIFACTS_v1_0.md §1` as `canonical_id: PORTAL_REDESIGN_TRACKER`, `status: LIVING`.
- `CLAUDE.md §C — Mandatory reading (per session)` adds both VISION and TRACKER at item #12 (or appropriate position).
- `mirror_enforcer.py` exit 0 — Claude-only mirror, no Gemini-side update needed.

Until then this artifact is informational and any session is free to challenge or amend it.
