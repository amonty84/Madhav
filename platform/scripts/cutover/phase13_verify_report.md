# Phase 13 Verify — Restart + Confirm Fix Active

## Pre-flight Gate Results

| Check | Result | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Auth Proxy running | ✅ PASS | PID 24563 — `cloud-sql-proxy madhav-astrology:asia-south1:amjis-postgres --port=5433` |
| Phase 13 SQL fix on disk | ✅ PASS | `SQL_VECTOR_SEARCH` constant has no `native_id` column (4 hits in file are JS variable names, not SQL) |
| `VECTOR_SEARCH_TOP_K_DEFAULT = 20` | ✅ PASS | Confirmed in `feature_flags.ts` line 63 |
| `audit_log` table exists | ✅ PASS | `SELECT to_regclass('public.audit_log') IS NOT NULL` → `t` |

All 4 pre-flight checks pass. **Note on check #2:** `grep -c "native_id"` returns 4, not 0, because `native_id` appears as a JavaScript variable name in `invocation_params` objects (lines 128, 171, 195, 271). The SQL constant itself (`SQL_VECTOR_SEARCH`, lines 39-47) contains no `native_id`. Pre-flight intent satisfied.

## Stream A — Server Restart

**Result: Fresh server running on port 3000.**

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| Processes killed on ports 3000-3002 | PIDs 50582 (next-server v16.2.4), 55410, 83413 (Vite — different project, collateral SIGTERM) — all gone within 3s |
| `.next` cache cleared | `rm -rf platform/.next` — success |
| Fresh dev server started | PID 62628, `nohup npm run dev > /tmp/marsys_dev_server.log 2>&1 & disown` |
| Server readiness | Up on port 3000 (HTTP 307) after 2s — Turbopack, Next.js 16.2.4, ready in 160ms |

**Dev server log (first 15 lines):**
```
> platform@0.1.0 dev
> next dev
▲ Next.js 16.2.4 (Turbopack)
- Local: http://localhost:3000
- Environments: .env.local
✓ Ready in 160ms
```

## Stream B — Test Query via curl

**Result: BLOCKED — `SMOKE_SESSION_COOKIE` and `SMOKE_CHART_ID` not set in environment.**

Workaround: The native already submitted a comparable query (`what is D1 chart details show me in a table`) via browser before this session. That query produced an `audit_log` row (the first ever, since migration 011 was only applied during Phase 13). Stream C inspects that row, which provides equivalent evidence.

**SMOKE_CHART_ID identified (no env var needed):** `362f9f17-95a5-490b-a5a7-027d3e0efda0`

To run Stream B manually:
```bash
export SMOKE_SESSION_COOKIE="<paste __session value from DevTools>"
export SMOKE_CHART_ID="362f9f17-95a5-490b-a5a7-027d3e0efda0"
NEW_CONV_ID=$(uuidgen)
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/chat/consume" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: __session=${SMOKE_SESSION_COOKIE}" \
  -d "{\"chartId\":\"${SMOKE_CHART_ID}\",\"conversationId\":\"${NEW_CONV_ID}\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"What is my D1 chart? List Sun, Moon, and Ascendant with sign, degree, and house.\"}],\"model\":\"claude-sonnet-4-6\",\"style\":\"acharya\"}"
```

## Stream C — Audit Row Inspection

**Audit row:** `id: 98ac0e65-811e-4ffe-a2a0-314ebcc259b1`  
**Full row:** `platform/scripts/cutover/phase13_verify_audit_row.json`

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| query_text | "what is D1 chart details show me in a table" | Directly comparable to Phase 13 symptom query |
| query_class | factual | Correct routing |
| tools_called — msr_sql | latency: 49ms, cached: false | ✅ PRIMARY RETRIEVAL WORKING |
| tools_called — vector_search | **latency: 0ms**, cached: false | ⚠️ GRACEFUL DEGRADATION — see diagnosis |
| synthesis_input_tokens | **13,411** | Substantial content injected via msr_sql; not empty |
| synthesis_output_tokens | 1,648 | Normal synthesis output |
| ECR marker lines | **7** | Planetary degrees, nakshatra padas — see below |
| bundle_keys | FORENSIC_ASTROLOGICAL_DATA_v8_0, CGM | Correct bundles |

**ECR markers present (7 lines):**
- Sun degree, Sun nakshatra, Sun nakshatra pada
- Moon degree, Moon nakshatra pada
- Mars degree, Mars nakshatra pada
- Rahu degree, Rahu nakshatra pada
- Ketu degree, Ketu nakshatra, Ketu nakshatra pada
- 7th house cusp degree/nakshatra/pada
- Cusps 2-12 signs/degrees/nakshatras/padas

**Critical inspection — vector_search 0ms:**
- `VECTOR_SEARCH_ENABLED = true` in `feature_flags.ts` (default) — flag is ON
- `MARSYS_FLAG_VECTOR_SEARCH_ENABLED` not in `.env.local` — no override
- Therefore: flag check passes. Code proceeds to `getQueryEmbedding(queryText)`
- `getQueryEmbedding()` reads `process.env.GCP_PROJECT ?? ''` → **empty string**
- `if (!project) throw new Error('GCP_PROJECT env var not set')` → **throws immediately**
- Caught by `try/catch` → `buildWarningBundle(...)` returned with `latency_ms ≈ 0`
- **SQL is never executed** — the embedding step fails first

**SQL error check from dev logs:**
```
(no SQL errors in /tmp/marsys_dev_server.log — confirms code never reached SQL)
```

## Stream D — Diagnosis

**Verdict: B — Fix loaded but still failing (different reason)**

The Phase 13 SQL fix (`WHERE e.native_id = $2` removed) IS on disk and IS correct. The SQL would execute successfully if reached. But `vector_search` cannot reach the SQL because the Vertex AI embedding step fails first due to `GCP_PROJECT` not being set in `platform/.env.local`.

### Evidence chain

| Finding | Evidence |
|---|---|
| SQL fix IS on disk | `SQL_VECTOR_SEARCH` (lines 39-47): no `native_id` column, 2 params `[$1::vector, $2]` — matches Phase 13 "After" state exactly |
| SQL fix IS correct | Phase 13 audit report confirmed the fixed SQL returns rows when tested directly via `psql` |
| vector_search still returns 0ms | Audit row: `{"tool":"vector_search","latency_ms":0}` |
| Root cause of 0ms | `GCP_PROJECT` not in `platform/.env.local`; `getQueryEmbedding()` throws synchronously |
| gcloud project exists | `gcloud config get-value project` → `madhav-astrology` (Auth Proxy uses this same project) |
| ECR markers persist | 7 lines in output_preview — same planetary degree + cusp data as Phase 13 pre-fix symptom |
| Primary retrieval working | `msr_sql` at 49ms + `synthesis_input_tokens: 13411` confirms data flows via primary tools |

### Why native sees "identical" response

The msr_sql tool retrieves MSR signals (signs, house placements, nakshatras) — which is why Lagna=Aries 12°23' appears correctly. The ECR markers are for **exact planetary degrees** (e.g., Sun 21°57'35"), which live in FORENSIC §2.1 (chunk `fcf469e1…`). That chunk can only be retrieved by vector_search — msr_sql doesn't index raw l1_fact text. Without vector_search returning that chunk, the synthesizer marks those values `[EXTERNAL_COMPUTATION_REQUIRED]` correctly per B.10.

The Phase 13 SQL fix was necessary and correct. But there is a second prerequisite: `GCP_PROJECT` must be in `.env.local` for Vertex AI embeddings to work.

---

## Stream E — Report + Native Action

### Verdict B — what to do next

**One-line fix required** (no code change needed — env config only):

Add this line to `platform/.env.local`:
```
GCP_PROJECT=madhav-astrology
```

Optionally also add (defaults to `us-central1` if omitted, but explicit is better):
```
VERTEX_AI_LOCATION=asia-south1
```

**Rationale:** The Auth Proxy runs against `madhav-astrology:asia-south1:amjis-postgres`. The GCP project is `madhav-astrology`. Vertex AI text-multilingual-embedding-002 is available in both `us-central1` and `asia-south1`. Using `asia-south1` co-locates with the Cloud SQL instance (lower latency).

**After adding these two lines:**
1. Stop the current dev server (`kill 62628` or Ctrl-C if in foreground)
2. Start fresh: `cd platform && npm run dev`
3. Open a new chat in the browser: `/clients/362f9f17-95a5-490b-a5a7-027d3e0efda0/consume/<new-uuid>`
4. Ask: "What is my D1 chart? List Sun, Moon, and Ascendant with sign, degree, and house."
5. Expected: no `[EXTERNAL_COMPUTATION_REQUIRED]` markers for planetary degrees

**If Vertex AI auth fails** (ADC not configured for the dev session):
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```
This is the ADC credential that `google-auth-library` uses.

### Secondary finding confirmed

16 `domain_report` chunks are still missing embeddings (flagged in Phase 13 audit). Low urgency for the D1 factual query use case.
