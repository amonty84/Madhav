## Assessment

GCS chart-documents bucket contains a **full snapshot** of an earlier build (all v1.0 dated). This is the build-state GCS output used for the deployed production app. The bundle composer reads from GCS via the `BUILD_STATE_GCS_BASE` path when resolving floor assets in production.

**Staleness risk:** FORENSIC v8.0 (local) vs `forensic_data_v1.0.md` (GCS, 87KB) — GCS version is missing all FORENSIC v2–v8 enrichments. MSR v3.0 (499 signals local) vs `msr_v1.0.md` (GCS, likely fewer signals). CGM v9.0 vs `cgm_v1.0.md`.

**Runtime impact:** The bundle composer first tries the GCS path (`BUILD_STATE_GCS_BASE`). If GCS assets are stale, synthesized answers in **production** use old document versions. Dev is unaffected (reads from local filesystem).

## Recommended Action
Re-run the build pipeline to upload current artifact versions to GCS:
1. `npm run manifest:build` (to refresh fingerprints)
2. Upload current L1/L2/L2.5 artifacts to the `charts/362f9f17.../` GCS path

This should be part of the standard deployment workflow after any canonical artifact update. Likely deferred from the Cloud SQL migration (Phase 11 cutover).

**Priority: MEDIUM** — production users may be getting answers synthesized from v1.0 artifacts.
