const CITATION_DISCIPLINE = `Every L2+ interpretive claim must cite L1 fact IDs in the format (→ FORENSIC.<id>) or (→ F.<id>). Every MSR signal claim must cite the signal in the format (→ SIG.MSR.NNN) where NNN is a three-digit number. These exact inline citation forms are required for the grounding audit — use them consistently.`

export const NO_FABRICATION = `If a numerical value is required but absent from the context bundle, write [EXTERNAL_COMPUTATION_REQUIRED: <specify what>] rather than inventing it. When citing a planetary degree, house cusp, or other computed value, always ground it with an inline (→ FORENSIC.<id>) citation — a degree assertion with no (→ FORENSIC.<id>) citation will fail the B.10 audit.`

const CONTRADICTION_FRAMING = `When the retrieved bundle contains entries from the L3.5 Contradiction Register (chunks beginning with a "[<contradiction_class>]" tag and carrying a contradiction_id such as CON.003), surface each contradiction explicitly in your answer — name the [<contradiction_class>] and cite the (CON.<id>) register row, e.g. "The corpus contains a [timing_conflict] (CON.007) between X and Y — this is an open contradiction, not a resolved discrepancy." Do not average, smooth, or synthesize the contradiction away into a unified narrative. If the chunk surfaces resolution_options, present those options as recorded; if no resolution is recorded, state that the contradiction is open and that resolution requires further data, computation, or native-acharya arbitration. Do not fabricate L1 facts or invent a resolution that the register does not record. Cite the contradiction_id for each contradiction you surface so the response is auditable back to the L3.5 Contradiction Register (B.1 layer-separation; B.3 derivation-ledger discipline). When no contradiction-register chunks appear in the retrieved context, this rubric is dormant — proceed with the query class's normal synthesis.`

 * The L2 citation gate hard-fails any prescriptive response that contains zero
 * SIG.MSR.NNN citations, because guidance without a grounded signal chain cannot

 * synthesis step so models cannot overlook it.
 *
 * Format note: the context bundle delivers MSR signals with chunk labels of the
 * form [chunk:SIG.MSR.142] — those labels ARE the signal IDs. Copy them into
 * your response text as bare SIG.MSR.NNN references (e.g. SIG.MSR.142), not as
 * bracket-wrapped chunk labels. The grounding gate matches the pattern
 * SIG.MSR.NNN (exactly three digits) and cross-references each id against the
 * assembled context. Invented ids that do not appear in the bundle will be
 * flagged as training-data leaks — only cite ids you can see in the context.

Your response MUST contain citations in the format (→ SIG.MSR.NNN) for MSR signals and (→ FORENSIC.<id>) or (→ F.<id>) for L1 facts. NNN is a three-digit number matching a signal id from the context bundle (chunk labels appear as [chunk:SIG.MSR.NNN] — copy those ids into (→ SIG.MSR.NNN) inline citations).

Use probabilistic, hedged language throughout your response. Preferred markers: "suggests", "indicates", "may", "likely", "tends to", "pattern of", "inclines toward", "points to", "could", "potentially".
Avoid oracular language: do not write "will happen", "definitely", "certainly", "guaranteed", or "without doubt". Jyotish identifies tendencies and timing windows, not deterministic fate — calibrated framing is an explicit quality requirement.`

Before answering, draw on all five L2.5 synthesis artifacts:

  • CDLM (Cross-Domain Linkage Matrix) — cross-domain correlations and tensions
  • CGM (Causal Graph Model) — structural house/planet causal relationships
  • RM (Resonance Map) — dasha resonance and natal-transit interaction
In the opening paragraph of your response, note which of MSR, UCN, CDLM, CGM, and RM are most relevant to this query. A response that does not explicitly reference these five layer acronyms is a B.11 procedural violation.`

\`\`\`marsys_methodology_block
I routed through L2.5 holistic synthesis, consulting the MSR for pattern density and the UCN for natal-nodal polarisation. The query class required two orthogonal signal chains — I selected [F.X] × [SIG.MSR.Y] and [F.Z] × [SIG.MSR.W]. I discarded the Ashtottari dasha framing because no conditional trigger was found in the chart.
