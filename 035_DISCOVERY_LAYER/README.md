# 035_DISCOVERY_LAYER — L4 Discovery Layer

The Discovery Layer is the fourth architectural stratum of AM-JIS, sitting above the L3
Domain Reports and receiving input from L2.5 Holistic Synthesis. Its purpose is to surface
emergent cross-domain patterns, resonances, contradictions, and clusters that are not visible
within any single domain report — the kinds of insights that require holding the entire
corpus in working memory simultaneously.

Per `PHASE_B_PLAN_v1_0.md §A` items 1 and 5:

1. **Surfaces patterns and contradictions across layers and systems** that no individual
   astrologer could hold in working memory — this is the Discovery Layer's primary value
   proposition over domain-siloed L3 analysis.

5. **Makes time-indexed, probabilistic, calibrated predictions testable against lived reality**
   — the Discovery Layer is the prediction-generation engine; all forward-looking claims
   emitted here are logged to `06_LEARNING_LAYER/PREDICTION_LEDGER/prediction_ledger.jsonl`
   before outcomes are observed (Learning Layer discipline rule #4 — held-out prospective data
   is sacrosanct).

## Activation Sequence

- **B.0 (this session):** Scaffold + migration. No discovery work yet.
- **B.1:** Ingestion — chunk L2.5 corpus into `rag_chunks` table.
- **B.2:** Chunker implementation — per `SCHEMAS/chunker_spec_v1_0.md`.
- **B.3:** Graph construction — citation edges + CGM edge proposals.
- **B.3.5:** CGM rebuild — `CGM_v9_0.md` with 8-karaka lock.
- **B.4:** RAG retrieval layer — hybrid vector + BM25 + graph.
- **B.5:** Discovery Layer activation — first live discovery runs; REGISTERS/INDEX.json populated.

## Layer Tags

All content produced in this layer carries the layer tag `[L4 Discovery Layer]`. Claims that
surface from the Discovery Layer and are routed back to users carry the disclosure tier per
`MACRO_PLAN_v2_0.md §Ethical Framework`.
