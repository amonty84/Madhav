# LL.1 Two-Pass Approval — pass_1 surrogate review

## §1 — Scope and methodology

This document records **pass_1** of the two-pass approval discipline mandated by
`SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL_v1_0.md §3.1(c)`:

> *"(c) Two-pass approval recorded. Claude has issued an initial weight record in
> `signal_weights/shadow/` AND Gemini has reviewed the record in the red-team cadence per
> `MACRO_PLAN §LL-Appendix.D` ownership rule (Claude scaffolds; Gemini red-teams every
> third session and at every macro-phase close). Both approvals are recorded in the
> weight record's `approval_chain` field."*

The 30 signals enumerated in §2 already meet criteria §3.1(a) (N_observations ≥ 3),
§3.1(b) (match_rate variance ≤ 0.3), and §3.2 (mean_match_rate ≥ 0.4) by construction —
the M4-B-S1-LL1-SHADOW-WEIGHTS computation flagged them `promotion_eligible_pending_two_pass`
because exactly that gate (§3.1(c)) was the only criterion not yet discharged. This
session discharges pass_1; pass_2 is **NAP.M4.5** (native spot-check at M4-B close).

**Surrogate-reviewer disclosure.** Pass_1 is performed by **Claude-surrogate-M4-B-S2**
acting as a stand-in for Gemini. Gemini was not available synchronously for this session.
Per `MACRO_PLAN §Multi-Agent Collaboration` and the M4-B-S2 brief hard constraint, the
surrogate role is flagged **explicitly and not represented as live Gemini output**. The
surrogate review applies the same rubric Gemini would apply (see §3 below), but
governance treats it as a structural placeholder until Gemini is reachable. Pass_2
(NAP.M4.5 — native) is the binding sign-off; if Gemini becomes reachable before M4-B
close, an addendum to this document captures Gemini's verdict and either ratifies or
contests the surrogate decisions per `GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL §K.3`.

**Demotion rule applied (per M4-B-S2 brief hard constraint).** Any signal whose
`mean_lit_score < 0.4` OR `variance > 0.3` in the shadow file is demoted to
`shadow_indefinite` regardless of the §3.1(c) gate state. The shadow-write phase already
filtered such signals (52 in the `shadow_indefinite_low_match_rate` bucket; 13 in
`shadow_indefinite_high_variance`); none of the 30 promotion-eligible signals fall into
either condition on re-check. **0 demotions** in pass_1 review.

**Inputs verified.**
- `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SIGNAL_WEIGHT_CALIBRATION/signal_weights/shadow/ll1_shadow_weights_v1_0.json`
  — 380 signal entries; summary block reports 30 promotion-eligible / 285 insufficient /
  52 low-match-rate / 13 high-variance. Re-derivation by reading the file confirms
  matching counts (no fabricated computation per B.10).
- `06_LEARNING_LAYER/SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL_v1_0.md` v1.0 APPROVED 2026-05-02 (NAP.M4.4).
- `06_LEARNING_LAYER/OBSERVATIONS/lel_event_match_records.json` — frozen; 9 held-out
  events sacrosanct (Learning Layer discipline #4); not touched by this session.

## §2 — Promotion-eligible signal table (all 30)

Re-derived by reading `ll1_shadow_weights_v1_0.json` directly. All entries satisfy
§3.1(a)–(b) and §3.2 by their `status: promotion_eligible_pending_two_pass` flag. The
columns below mirror the audit-trail metadata required by `SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §6`.

**Distribution by tier.**

- **Tier A — high-confidence (mean=1.0, var=0.0, N≥3):** 24 signals (all CTR/CVG/SIG.NN
  semantic-class entries plus SIG.MSR.013/030/163/170/198/229/251/278/291/295/297/300/
  301/391/476). These signals fired in 100% of their N training observations.
- **Tier B — high-confidence-with-tolerance (mean ≥ 0.7, var ≤ 0.22):** 3 signals —
  RPT.DSH.01 (mean 0.80, var 0.16, N=4); SIG.MSR.145 (mean 0.91, var 0.09, N=11);
  SIG.MSR.402 (mean 0.73, var 0.22, N=11).
- **Tier C — borderline-passing (mean ≈ 0.45, var ≈ 0.27, N=11):** 3 signals —
  SIG.MSR.118, SIG.MSR.119, SIG.MSR.143. All three are in the `general` domain; all three
  satisfy §3.1(b) variance ≤ 0.3 and §3.2 match_rate ≥ 0.4 but only just. They are the
  candidates most likely to require NAP.M4.5 (pass_2) native scrutiny.

**Domain mapping note.** 11 signals carry `domain: unknown`. Per the M4-B-S1
SESSION_LOG entry: msr_domain_buckets.json is keyed by MSR signal IDs (`SIG.MSR.NNN`);
LEL events use semantic-class IDs (CTR, CVG, SIG.NN, RPT, DSH). Most observed signals
record `domain: "unknown"` as expected fallback, not a defect. Cross-system reconciliation
is M4-D scope per `PHASE_M4_PLAN`. This is informational; it does not alter pass_1
verdicts.

## §3 — Surrogate red-team review

Surrogate-reviewer (Claude-as-Gemini) applies the same heuristic Gemini would apply per
its L4 Discovery Layer connector role: numerical sanity, plausibility against the
training corpus, and visible failure modes (overfit by signal saturation; spurious
correlation with a single dominant event class; mean/variance combinations that hide
bimodal firing under a passing aggregate).

### §3.1 — Tier-A axis (24 signals, mean=1.0, var=0.0)

These 24 signals fired in every observation. At n=1 with N ∈ {3, 4, 5}, var=0.0 is the
strongest possible empirical pattern but also carries the strongest overfit risk:
*"signal X fires for every Y-event because Y-events are rare in this corpus and X happens
to fire on all of them."* The defenses already in the pipeline are:

- **Held-out partition discipline.** 9 LEL events are held out and contributed zero
  observations; if a Tier-A signal generalizes to those events at calibration time
  (M4-C `CALIBRATION_VALIDITY_TEST_M4C_v1_0.md`), that is independent confirmation. A
  Tier-A signal failing the held-out test is reverted per `SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §5`.
- **n=1 disclaimer.** All 24 weights carry the disclaimer through to production. The
  promotion is structural, not epistemic.
- **Two-pass discipline.** Pass_2 (NAP.M4.5) is the native's domain-knowledge filter
  against absurd matches.

**Surrogate verdict for all 24 Tier-A signals: approved (pending pass_2).** No demotion;
no hold. Each Tier-A signal individually passes the "would I (as surrogate Gemini)
pattern-propose this signal as a connector candidate at L4?" check by virtue of
firing on every training observation in its domain.

### §3.2 — Tier-B axis (3 signals, mean 0.73–0.91, var 0.09–0.22)

- **RPT.DSH.01** (mean 0.80, var 0.16, N=4). A repeat/dasha-class signal firing 4 of 4
  times for ~0.8 lit-score on average — high reliability with one-event tolerance.
  *Surrogate verdict:* approved.
- **SIG.MSR.145** (mean 0.91, var 0.09, N=11). 11-observation history is the largest in
  the eligible set; mean 0.91 with low variance is the strongest dataset-weighted
  signal in the file. *Surrogate verdict:* approved.
- **SIG.MSR.402** (mean 0.73, var 0.22, N=11). Borderline variance but well above
  match_rate threshold. *Surrogate verdict:* approved.

### §3.3 — Tier-C axis (3 signals, mean 0.45, var 0.27, N=11)

SIG.MSR.118, SIG.MSR.119, SIG.MSR.143 are the most-watched signals in this batch:

- They satisfy §3.1(b) (variance 0.2727 ≤ 0.3) and §3.2 (mean 0.4545 ≥ 0.4) by margins
  of 0.027 and 0.054 respectively.
- All three carry identical descriptive statistics (mean, variance, N), suggesting they
  may share an underlying mechanism in the MSR `general` domain or fire jointly across
  events. **Joint-firing is not by itself a defect** — it is exactly the kind of pattern
  L4 Discovery is designed to surface — but it warrants pass_2 attention because
  identical statistics across three distinct signal IDs invites a "are these really
  three signals or one signal counted three times?" question.
- At n=1 with the dominant statistical risk being overfit (`MACRO_PLAN §3.5.A
  Principle 1`), the lower mean lowers the overfit-overstatement risk: a signal firing
  "only" 45% of the time when expected is materially less likely to be a "fires on
  everything" artifact.
- The borderline variance 0.2727 places them within the noise band defined by
  `SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §3.1(b)`. Per the protocol's rationale, *"random firing leaves
  high variance; reliable firing leaves low variance"* — these three are at the inflection
  point. They fire reliably ~half the time, which is the threshold for "calibrated
  signal at n=1" per the protocol's match_rate ≥ 0.4 rationale.

**Surrogate verdict for all 3 Tier-C signals: approved-with-NAP.M4.5-flag.** All three
clear the §3 gates and the demotion rule (mean ≥ 0.4, var ≤ 0.3); they are **not
demoted**. They are flagged in the pass_1 notes for closer pass_2 native scrutiny —
specifically, the question "do SIG.MSR.118, .119, .143 represent independent calibrated
phenomena, or one phenomenon detected three ways?" should be answered explicitly at
NAP.M4.5.

### §3.4 — Cross-cutting checks

- **No Tier-A signal saturates any single training event class alone.** Spot-check:
  CTR.01 fires across EVT.2013.12.11.01, EVT.2021.01.XX.01, EVT.2022.XX.XX.02,
  EVT.2025.XX.XX.02, EVT.2026.03.20.01 — five different decades/years/event-class
  combinations. CTR.03 fires across 2013/2016/2021/2022/2023. The Tier-A signals
  generalize across the training set's chronological range; they are not artifacts of a
  single event cluster.
- **Held-out events untouched.** Re-verified by sampling: none of the 30 records'
  `observations` lists contain any of the 9 held-out event IDs (EVT.2008.06.09.01,
  EVT.2009.06.XX.01, EVT.2017.03.XX.01, EVT.2018.11.28.01, EVT.2019.05.XX.01,
  EVT.2022.01.03.01, EVT.2024.02.16.01, EVT.2025.05.XX.01, EVT.2026.01.XX.01).
- **No DIS.class.calibration_methodology entry open.** Kill-switch §4(d) clear.
- **No LEL version change since shadow-write.** LEL is at v1.6 (M4-A-CLOSE-LEL-PATCH
  2026-05-02); the shadow-write read v1.5/v1.6 contents (the GAP.M4A.04 patch added
  category tags only — no event additions, no chart_state changes, no match-rate impact).
  Kill-switch §4(c) clear.
- **No native halt instruction.** Kill-switch §4(b) clear (NAP.M4.5 is the next gate,
  not an active halt).
- **Learning-discipline rule #1 priors-locked: held.** No classical-prior overwrite
  attempted in any pass_1 verdict; weights remain in shadow until pass_2 + native
  notification per §3.1(d). Kill-switch §4(e) clear.

## §5.5 — Gemini reachability check (M4-B-S5, 2026-05-02)

Per AC.S5.7, this session attempted to reach Gemini for an independent supplemental
review of LL1_TWO_PASS_APPROVAL (the document only — no raw signal weight data and no
held-out event data, per Learning Layer discipline #4). Outcome:

**Result: NOT_REACHABLE.**

**Channels checked:**

- `gemini` / `gemini-cli` binary in PATH — not installed.
- Project-local Gemini SDK or HTTP wrapper (search across
  `platform/scripts/`, `platform/src/`, `00_ARCHITECTURE/`) — none found. Hits for
  `gemini` in source files refer to the static `.geminirules` /
  `.gemini/project_state.md` mirror-pair surfaces, not a live communication channel.
- Environment variables (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, etc.) — none set in session env.
- `~/.gemini/` directory exists with `oauth_creds.json` (Antigravity credentials), but
  no installed CLI binary or in-project tool that consumes them for synchronous
  agent-to-agent review.

**Interpretation.** The MARSYS-JIS multi-agent collaboration framework
(`PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_v2_2.md §D.11`, `GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL_v1_0.md §K`) is
operationalized today as **structural mirror-pair discipline over static surfaces**
(MP.1–MP.8 enforced by `mirror_enforcer.py`), not as live IPC. The "Gemini-side" is
authored when Gemini is invoked separately (e.g., via Antigravity sessions) and the two
sides reconcile asynchronously through the mirror surfaces. There is no synchronous
in-session channel from a Claude Code session to an active Gemini agent at the time of
this check.

**Consequence.**

- No supplemental Gemini-review row appended to §5 `approval_chain.gemini_reachability_addendum`.
- **R.LL1TPA.1 surrogate disclosure remains OPEN** (carry-forward) — next reachability
  attempt scheduled at **M4-C entry** (M4-B → M4-C transition), per AC.S5.7(b)
  protocol. If Gemini is reachable then, the addendum at §5 is appended at that time
  with Gemini's verdict; if Gemini ratifies, R.LL1TPA.1 closes; if Gemini contests,
  open `DIS.class.output_conflict` per `GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL §K.2`.
- Pass_2 (native) remains the binding final gate; production promotion is **not
  conditional** on Gemini reachability per `SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §3.1(c)+(d)`. The
  reachability check is an audit-trail discipline, not a promotion gate.

**Reachability check executed by:** Claude Code session M4-B-S5-NAP-M45-EXECUTE
**Reachability check date:** 2026-05-02
**Next reachability attempt:** at M4-C entry session (whichever first opens after
M4-B close)

## §6 — Known residuals

- **R.LL1TPA.1 (LOW, OPEN — carry-forward to M4-C entry) — surrogate-not-Gemini.**
  Pass_1 was performed by Claude-surrogate rather than Gemini per the Multi-Agent
  Collaboration framework. Reachability check executed at M4-B-S5 (this session)
  returned NOT_REACHABLE — no live channel from a Claude Code session to an active
  Gemini agent exists today; see §5.5 above. Carry-forward: re-attempt reachability at
  M4-C entry; if Gemini ratifies, R.LL1TPA.1 closes; if Gemini contests, open a
  `DIS.class.output_conflict` entry per `GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL §K.2`. Pass_2
  (native) is the binding final gate and has been discharged 2026-05-02; this residual
  is audit-trail completeness only, not a production-blocker. Severity LOW because
  (a) the surrogate role was flagged explicitly throughout, (b) production weights are
  now gated by pass_2 (discharged), (c) the surrogate applied the same numerical
  rubric Gemini would apply.
- **R.LL1TPA.2 (CLOSED 2026-05-02 NAP.M4.5) — Tier-C joint-firing question.**
  SIG.MSR.118, .119, .143 carry identical descriptive statistics across 11 observations
  each. Native verdict at pass_2: **(a) three independent calibrated phenomena** —
  distinct planetary entities, non-overlapping event subsets (zero triple overlap;
  largest pairwise overlap 3 of 11), distinct Jyotish valences (two auspicious-yoga
  absences + one inauspicious-yoga absence). All three approved as independent signals.
  Held-out partition at M4-C is the generalization check.
- **R.LL1TPA.3 (LOW) — domain=unknown for 11 signals.** Domain mapping limitation
  inherited from M4-B-S1 (msr_domain_buckets.json keyed by MSR IDs; LEL semantic-class
  IDs CTR/CVG/SIG.NN/RPT/DSH absent). Cross-system reconciliation is M4-D scope per
  `PHASE_M4_PLAN`. Pass_1 outcomes do not depend on domain resolution.
- **R.LL1TPA.4 (DOC-ONLY) — KR.M4A.CLOSE.1 inheritance.** `CALIBRATION_RUBRIC_v1_0.md`
  frontmatter still reads `status: AWAITING_NATIVE_APPROVAL` despite NAP.M4.1 APPROVED
  Option B at v1.3. Semantic approval is intact (every event-match record cites
  rubric_option=B; pass_1 review honors rubric_option=B). Frontmatter flip schedulable
  as a small follow-up; non-blocking for pass_2.
- **R.LL1TPA.5 (DEFERRED) — LL.1 stability gate for LL.2.** Per
  `SHADOW_MODE_PROTOCOL §3.5 LL.2`, LL.2 edge-modulator promotion requires both endpoint
  signals' LL.1 weights to be in production. This is an LL.2-time concern (M4-B-S3+),
  not an LL.1 concern; surfaced here for cross-mechanism awareness.

No HIGH or CRITICAL residuals.

## §7 — Changelog

- **v1.0 (2026-05-02, M4-B-S2-MIRROR-TWOPASS):** Initial publication. Pass_1 surrogate
  review of all 30 promotion-eligible LL.1 signals. 30 approved / 0 held / 0 demoted.
  3 flagged for NAP.M4.5 (pass_2) closer scrutiny: SIG.MSR.118, .119, .143 (Tier-C
  borderline, identical statistics). Production-pending file produced at
  `signal_weights/production/ll1_weights_promoted_v1_0.json` with status
  `production_pending_pass_2`. 5 known residuals enumerated at §6 (3 LOW + 1 DOC-ONLY +
  1 DEFERRED); 0 HIGH/CRITICAL.
- **v1.1 (2026-05-02, M4-B-S5-NAP-M45-EXECUTE):** Pass_2 (NAP.M4.5) discharged.
  Frontmatter `status` flipped `PASS_1_COMPLETE_PENDING_NAP_M4_5` → `TWO_PASS_COMPLETE`;
  `version` bumped 1.0 → 1.1; pass_2_outcome added to frontmatter (30 approved / 0 held
  / 0 demoted). §5 `approval_chain.pass_2` block populated with native verdict, joint-
  question verdict for SIG.MSR.118/.119/.143 = (a) three independent calibrated
  phenomena, and joint_question_reasoning. New §5.5 added recording Gemini reachability
  check executed M4-B-S5 (result: NOT_REACHABLE; R.LL1TPA.1 carry-forward to M4-C
  entry). §6 R.LL1TPA.1 reframed as OPEN-carry-forward (gemini-reachability audit-
  trail, not a production-blocker); R.LL1TPA.2 CLOSED with native verdict. Production
  file (`ll1_weights_promoted_v1_0.json`) and shadow file
  (`ll1_shadow_weights_v1_0.json`) patched same session: 30 status flips
  `production_pending_pass_2` → `production`; outer `weights_in_production_register`
  flipped false → true; per-signal `approval_chain.pass_2_*` fields populated; shadow
  outer metadata adds `variance_estimator: "sample"` (closes F.RT.S4.1 from M4-B-S4
  red-team). 0 HIGH/CRITICAL residuals.

*End of LL1_TWO_PASS_APPROVAL_v1_0.md v1.1. Two-pass complete; downstream pipeline may
consume the 30 promoted weights with the n=1 disclaimer carried through.*
