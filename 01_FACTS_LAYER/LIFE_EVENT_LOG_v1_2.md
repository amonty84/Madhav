# LIFE EVENT LOG — Abhisek Mohanty (v1.0)

## §1 — META

### §1.1 — Purpose

This document is L1 (Facts Layer) per Architecture §C.1 and §D.2. It is the single highest-leverage asset for acharya-grade sight: the empirical calibration corpus that lets signal-patterns from the chart be validated against actual lived events. Every entry here is factual (what happened, when). No interpretation. Interpretation lives at L2+ via the `retrodictive_match` field, which points to Deep Analysis v1.2.1 signals (SIG.*/CVG.*/CTR.*) but does not generate new analysis.

### §1.2 — How to Read This Document

- **§3 is the main event log**, chronologically ordered, 36 entries (post-v1.1 corrections).
- **§4** captures chronic patterns and traits that are not dated point-events (stammering, headaches, etc.).
- **§5** captures the 5 inner-turning-point periods (2007, 2012-13, 2016, 2018-21, 2022-24) characterized by the native.
- **§6** is a gap register — things mentioned in source material but not yet dated with precision; these are Session 3+ targets.
- **§7** is an aggregate retrodictive-match summary: how many events the chart "predicts" and where the misses cluster.

### §1.3 — Event ID Format

`EVT.YYYY.MM.DD.XX` — date first (YYYY-MM-DD when known; XX placeholder where unknown), then sequence number XX for events on the same day.

### §1.4 — Schema (per Architecture §D.2)

```yaml
EVT.YYYY.MM.DD.XX:
  date: [YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-XX | YYYY-XX-XX]
  date_confidence: [exact | month-exact | year-exact | year-approx | vague]

```

### §1.5 — Data Provenance Discipline

Every chart_state_at_event field is sourced per Architecture §B.10 (No Fabricated Computation):
- `vimshottari_md`, `vimshottari_ad`, `vimshottari_id` → from v6.0 §5.1 table (authoritative)
- `yogini_md`, `yogini_id` → from v6.0 §5.2 table (authoritative)
- `chara_md_ad`, `chara_id` → from v6.0 §5.3 table (authoritative)
- `sade_sati_phase` → from v6.0 §21 table (authoritative for Cycle 2, 2020+); Cycle 1 (~1993-2000) is not in v6.0 and is flagged for Facts Layer v7.0 completion
- `transits_of_note`, `eclipses_within_6mo`, `retrograde_activity`, `ashtakavarga_SAV_transit_sign` → **POPULATED in v1.2** via Swiss Ephemeris self-compute (see also `EVENT_CHART_STATES_v1_0.md` for full per-event detail including planetary positions, panchang, Ashtakavarga SAV across all 7 signs, full transit note list)

---

## §2 — SCOPE AND CONVENTIONS

### §2.1 — Included

- All dateable events from native's "Consolidated Life Facts.docx" (9 sections, 93 lines)
- All events surfaced in Session 2 elicitation responses (Batches 1-3)
- Events with date_confidence ranging from `exact` to `year-approx`

### §2.2 — Excluded from §3 Event Log

- Chronic traits (undated) → §4
- Period summaries (inner turning points without specific dates) → §5
- Vague references ("sometime in childhood") → §6 Gap Register

### §2.3 — Sensitivity Note (per Bootstrap §9.4)

Native granted full elicitation scope with no privacy boundaries (§J.3 of Architecture). This document contains sensitive material: loss of grandfather and father, marriage strain leading to current separation, physical infidelity (logged as relationship #2 and #3 timespans, not as behavioral events), an adolescent relationship beginning at age 14, a significant financial deception event, and an intense peak-life period characterized by partying and sexual romance. All logged factually per architecture principle B.7 (Honest-Calibration Scope).

## §3 — EVENT LOG (CHRONOLOGICAL)

*v1.2 note: chart_state_at_event fields now populated. For complete per-event chart details (all 9 planet positions, full panchang, full SAV matrix, exhaustive transit notes), see companion file `EVENT_CHART_STATES_v1_0.md`. This file preserves the canonical retrodictive narrative.*

### Era 1: Birth & Early Life (1984-1995)

```yaml

    signals_that_missed: []
    retrodictive_reasoning: Birth itself is the "source event" — every natal signal fires from here. Event included for anchoring; retrodictive match is tautological.
  notes: Foundational event. All downstream retrodictive tagging references this chart state.
```

### Era 2: Adolescence and Headaches (1995-2000)

```yaml
EVT.1995.XX.XX.01:
  date: 1995-XX-XX
  date_confidence: year-approx
  category: health
  subcategory: chronic_onset
  description: Severe headaches onset around 1995 (age 11). Became a defining health motif of early life; also reduced computer/screen usage because screen time catalyzed headaches.
  magnitude: significant
  valence: negative
  native_reflection: "Suffered from severe headaches since around 1995, a major part of early life. Screen time became a catalyst."
  chart_state_at_event:
    vimshottari_md: Saturn
    vimshottari_ad: Mercury
    vimshottari_id: DSH.V.007
    yogini_md: Ulka / Saturn
    yogini_id: DSH.Y.003
    chara_md_ad: Taurus / Cancer (approx, depends on exact month)
    chara_id: DSH.C.022 (if May-Dec 1995)
    sade_sati_phase: Cycle1_approx_peak_Saturn_Aquarius (~1995-1998, not in v6.0 §21 — see §6 Gap Register)
    transits_of_note: ["Saturn transit Pisces = 12H from Lagna", "Jupiter transit Scorpio = 8H from Lagna"]
    eclipses_within_6mo: ["Lunar Partial Libra -60d", "Solar Annular+Central Aries -46d", "Lunar Penumbral Pisces +115d", "Solar Total+Central Libra +131d"]
    retrograde_activity: ["Mercury retro in Taurus", "Jupiter retro in Scorpio"]
    ashtakavarga_SAV_transit_sign: "Sat=27, Jup=29, Sun=29, Moon=31 (transit signs)"
  retrodictive_match:
    predicted_by_chart: yes
    signals_that_matched: [SIG.01, SIG.11, CTR.01]
    signals_that_missed: [SIG.13 (Sade Sati Cycle 1 not in v6.0 data)]
    retrodictive_reasoning: Saturn MD active (2nd Saturn peak of life). Saturn Cycle 1 Sade Sati Peak (Saturn transiting Aquarius = natal Moon sign) plausibly ~1995-1998. Saturn + Aquarius Moon = mental weight, headaches. Mars-Saturn 7H exalted conjunction (SIG.15) aspects Aries Lagna (head) at 180°.
  notes: Cycle 1 Sade Sati (1993-2000 approx) is not tabulated in v6.0 §21 — v7.0 should add it. This gap flagged in §6.
```

### Era 3: Teen Years, Computer-Prodigy Recognition, First Relationship (1998-2003)

```yaml
EVT.1998.02.16.01:
  date: 1998-02-16
  date_confidence: exact
  category: relationship
  subcategory: romantic_long_term_started
  description: Relationship #1 started (age 14). This is the childhood girlfriend who later became native's wife (married 2013-12-11). Total duration as relationship pre-marriage was ~15 years.
  magnitude: life-altering
  valence: mixed
  native_reflection: Confirmed by native in Session 2 as "the next time I do it" (marriage). Defining long-term relationship.
  chart_state_at_event:
    vimshottari_md: Saturn
    vimshottari_ad: Ketu
    vimshottari_id: DSH.V.008
    yogini_md: Siddha / Venus
    yogini_id: DSH.Y.004
    chara_md_ad: Gemini / Leo
    chara_id: DSH.C.026
    sade_sati_phase: Cycle1_approx_peak_Saturn_Aquarius (~1995-1998, not in v6.0)
    transits_of_note: ["Jupiter transit on natal Moon (Aquarius) — gajakesari-class", "Ketu transit on natal Moon (Aquarius)", "Saturn transit Pisces = 12H from Lagna", "Jupiter transit Aquarius = 11H from Lagna"]
    eclipses_within_6mo: ["Solar Partial+Non-Central Leo -166d", "Lunar Total Pisces -152d", "Solar Total+Central Aquarius +10d", "Lunar Penumbral Leo +25d"]
    retrograde_activity: []
    ashtakavarga_SAV_transit_sign: "Sat=27, Jup=24, Sun=24, Moon=26 (transit signs)"
  retrodictive_match:
    predicted_by_chart: partial
    signals_that_matched: [SIG.04 (Moon AK 11H/Chalit-12 = emotional attachment signature), CVG.07 (Gemini 3H nexus — UL+Vivaha Saham+A5+A11 all in Gemini), SIG.12 (Venus weak — relational friction built in)]
    signals_that_missed: [Ketu AD would not typically be a partnership-starting signal in classical reading; Venus Yogini (Siddha) gives romantic overlay but the Ketu AD underpins detachment. Pattern: early-Saturn-Ketu relationships tend to be intense but karmically bonded, not conventional — fits native's "childhood girlfriend → wife → separation" arc.]
    retrodictive_reasoning: Gemini 3H nexus CVG.07 is the strongest structural match — Vivaha Saham (marriage-specific sensitive point) + UL (Upapada — spouse karma) + A5 + A11 all clustered in Gemini suggests the spouse relationship's origin-node is Gemini-inflected. Age-14 onset + 15-year duration-to-marriage is a Saturn-MD signature (Saturn = long-gestation, delay-before-culmination).
  notes: Physical infidelity category, per native's clarification, is effectively captured by concurrent tracks R#2 (Jan 2004–Jan 2007, entirely pre-marriage; corrected in v1.1) and R#3 (Oct 2012–Oct 2022) overlapping with this R#1 track. Only R#3 overlaps with formal marriage (Dec 2013 onward).

    signals_that_missed: [IIT preparation outcome (whether he cracked IIT) — answered ambiguously by native; treated as "unsuccessful at IIT, successful at SRM Chennai engineering" per doc. SIG.08 Lakshmi Yoga is dharmic-wealth, less applicable to exam prep. Saturn MD = slow-burn; exam outcomes under Saturn MD tend to be delayed/tough-won.]
  notes: Per doc, "Could not secure admission in A1-tier universities initially but achieved entry into strong institutions just below that level." IIT attempt appears unsuccessful; engineering pursued at SRM Chennai instead.

    signals_that_missed: [Specific infidelity-structure signal not computed in v1.2.1 — belongs in v2.0 Pattern Library.]
    retrodictive_reasoning: Saturn MD with Moon AK AD just ending (Feb 24, 2004) + immediate transition to Saturn-Mars AD (fire/assertion) + Sankata/Rahu Yogini starting = complex relational-imprinting window. Moon AK AD coinciding with a non-primary romantic start suggests soul-level engagement with "the other woman" archetype at 19-20. Chara MD/AD both Gemini = triple Gemini signature (Gemini is the chart's 3H nexus per CVG.07 with UL + A5 + A11 + Vivaha Saham clustered) = romantic-relational-complexity coded at age onset.
  notes: Per native's explicit clarification in Session 2, this + R#3 effectively capture the "physical infidelity" category. R#2 entirely pre-marriage — the overlap that becomes concerning is with R#1 (the relationship that becomes the wife in 2013), not with the formal marriage.

Academic-mentor framing (native's words) reinforces: Jupiter = guru, knowledge-lineage, teacher — all converge on grandfather role.

## §4 — CHRONIC PATTERNS AND UNDATED TRAITS

These are not dated point-events but recurring patterns or constitutional traits. They belong at L1 as factual descriptions; their astrological causation is computed at L2.

```yaml
PATTERN.STAMMER.01:
  trait: Stammering (speech disfluency)
  onset: childhood (specific date unknown)
  trajectory: Improved through adolescence and adulthood; recently resurfaced (2024-2026 era)
  native_reflection: "Experienced stammering in childhood, which improved but has recently resurfaced."
  likely_astrological_basis: Mercury MD peak stabilized speech; Mercury MD-Saturn AD (from Dec 2024) may be producing the resurfacing via Saturn-pressure-on-Mercury-significations.
```

```yaml
PATTERN.PHYSIQUE.01:
  trait: Height 6'3", lean-muscular build in peak (2012-2013), currently good/well-maintained at 42
  onset: peak physique 2012-2013 (overlaps XIMB period)
  native_reflection: "Previously possessed a very lean, muscular body and gained some modeling experience. Currently the physique has evolved from that peak muscular phase, it remains good and well-maintained."
  likely_astrological_basis: Aries Lagna (Mars dominance) + Mercury MD peak during 2012-2013 = physical peak. Sade Sati Cycle 2 (2020+) adds weight/slowing to typical physique.
```

  native_reflection: "Physically active by nature; sports participation directly correlates with better luck and prosperity." / "Luck, productivity, and social magnetism peak during active sports phases."
  likely_astrological_basis: Aries Lagna = Mars-ruled; Mars-engagement (sports, physical activity) = Lagna-lord activation, which strengthens overall chart delivery. Retrodictive pattern: basketball during 2012-2013 peak (§5.2) aligns with Mercury MD + Mars-engaged-via-sports.
```

```yaml
PATTERN.SLEEP_IRREGULARITY.01:
  trait: Sleep irregularities; undisciplined sleep impacts schedule and productivity; night hours boost creativity
  native_reflection: "Suffers from sleep irregularities; lack of discipline in sleep impacts schedule and productivity." / "Night hours boost creativity and work output, though they disrupt health and schedule."
  likely_astrological_basis: Moon AK Chalit-12 (SIG.05 + CVG.03) — Moon-in-12 is classical insomnia/night-mind signature. Foreign-delivery via-Moon-Chalit-12 also means mind operates in "foreign hours" (night).
```

```yaml
PATTERN.HEADACHES.01:
  trait: Severe headaches since ~1995; screen-time as trigger
  onset: circa 1995 (captured as EVT.1995.XX.XX.01 — the onset event; pattern is the persistence)
  native_reflection: "Suffered from severe headaches since around 1995, a major part of early life."
  likely_astrological_basis: Aries Lagna (head/brain), Sun in 10H (head/prominence) with Mars-Saturn aspect from 7H. Adolescent Sade Sati Cycle 1 Peak (Saturn transiting Aquarius on natal Moon) = headache-onset-catalyst.
```

```yaml
PATTERN.COMPUTER_APTITUDE.01:
  trait: Exceptional computer/programming aptitude from teenage onward; recognized early; returned to it recently
  native_reflection: "Was a 'successful geek' and extremely proficient with computers at a young age, achieving recognition." / "Back to it now."
  likely_astrological_basis: SIG.09 (Mercury Vargottama + Yogi + MD) = Mercury operational spine. Mercury = technology, programming, pattern-processing. Return-to-it post-2023 aligns with Marsys Technology vertical in Marsys Group.
```

## §5 — INNER TURNING-POINT PERIODS (Native's Self-Characterization)

```yaml
PERIOD.2007:
  dates: 2007 (calendar year)
  characterization: "Engineering completion + first job. Nothing heavier than a transition marker."
  native_reflection: "I don't think [2007] was in any way significant, only thing was I completed my BTEC, my engineering and started my first job."
  vimshottari: Saturn-Rahu AD (most of year) → Saturn-Jupiter AD (from Feb 9, 2008)
  yogini: Sankata/Rahu
  dominant_events_in_period: [EVT.2007.06.XX.01 (knee surgery), EVT.2007.06.XX.02 (engineering), EVT.2007.06.10.01 (Cognizant join)]
  retrodictive_note: Native's low valence for this period is consistent with Saturn-Rahu AD being a labor-grind AD rather than a peak period. The events happened but weren't accompanied by peak emotional/experiential intensity.
```

```yaml
PERIOD.2012_2013:
  dates: 2012 through 2013 (calendar years)
  characterization: "Best period of my life. Basketball, opposite sex, partying, ace in everything."
  native_reflection: "2012-13 was the best period of my life. I played basketball, enjoyed my time with the opposite sex. I had a lot of partying so it was an ace in everything. I can't forget that period."
  vimshottari: Mercury-Mercury AD (peak, through Jan 18, 2013) → Mercury-Ketu AD (Jan 18, 2013 → Jan 15, 2014)
  yogini: Mangala/Moon (through Dec 22, 2012) → Pingala/Sun (Dec 22, 2012 → Dec 22, 2014)
  dominant_events_in_period: [EVT.2012.09.XX.01 (modeling), EVT.2012.10.XX.01 (R#3 start), EVT.2013.03.XX.01 (XIMB graduation), EVT.2013.05.XX.01 (Mahindra Retail), EVT.2013.12.11.01 (marriage)]
  retrodictive_note: Mercury-Mercury AD is the chart's operational peak for Mercury-spine (Saraswati + Yogi + Vargottama + MD + all on same lord). PATTERN.SPORTS_LUCK.01 fires clearly (basketball). PATTERN.PHYSIQUE.01 peak (modeling at XIMB). Saraswati (SIG.07) = charisma in academic/performance arena. Classical result: MD-AD of same Yogi lord = experiential peak.
```

```yaml
PERIOD.2016:
  dates: 2016 (calendar year)
  characterization: "A bit stressful. Mahindra Retail crashed. Looking for a job."
  native_reflection: "2016 was a bit stressful when I was looking for a job outside Mahindra Retail as the company had crashed and that's when I decided to switch over to Tech Mahindra."
  vimshottari: Mercury-Venus AD (through Nov 15, 2016) → Mercury-Sun AD (from Nov 15, 2016)
  yogini: Dhanya/Jupiter
  dominant_events_in_period: [EVT.2016.XX.XX.01 (Mahindra Retail crash)]
  retrodictive_note: Venus AD = weakest-Shadbala planet (SIG.12) gets AD spotlight = professional instability. Exit of Venus AD in Nov 2016 + Sun AD start = resolution path (Sun 10H activated for Mar 2017 switch).
```

```yaml
PERIOD.2018_2021:
  dates: 2018 through 2021
  characterization_start: "Mentally traumatic time [2018] — father's death, hospital-running Hyderabad to Bhubaneswar."
  characterization_middle: "2019 to 21 in the US - exciting."
  native_reflection: "I lost my father, so it was a mentally traumatic time running a lot of the hospitals, running from Hyderabad to Neshwar. So but 2019 to 21 was in the US exciting."
  vimshottari: Mercury-Moon AD (late 2017-Feb 2019, peak during father's passing) → Mercury-Mars AD (Feb 2019-Feb 2020, US move) → Mercury-Rahu AD (Feb 2020-Sep 2022, US ongoing)
  yogini: Bhramari/Mars (Dec 22, 2017 → Dec 22, 2021)
  dominant_events_in_period: [EVT.2018.11.28.01 (father passed), EVT.2019.05.XX.01 (US move), EVT.2021.01.XX.01 (panic episode — moved here in v1.1 from 2022)]
  retrodictive_note: Split-valence period. Start = father's death under AK Moon AD (soul-event magnitude). Middle = US-stint under Mars-then-Rahu AD (Mars = initiative/action abroad; Rahu = foreign-amplification). End = Jan 2021 panic episode at Sade Sati Cycle 2 Rising peak (Saturn in Cap 12th from Moon, ~1 year into cycle) + Bhramari/Mars Yogini at maximum intensity. v1.1 correction makes this period coherent: Bhramari/Mars runs through Dec 2021 exactly bounding the "US exciting" phase and containing the panic-episode terminus.
```

```yaml
PERIOD.2022_2024:
  dates: 2022 through 2024
  characterization: "Mix. New relationships, rupture of old, success in professional career, lost US job, moved to India, pivotal — changed from salary to business, driven by turn of events and own decision."
  native_reflection: "22 to 24 was a mix, it was new relationships and rupture of old success in professional career in my job but I lost my job in the US moved to India in fact was a pivotal point where I completely changed my life from salary job to business which I couldn't have done otherwise was primarily driven by turn of events and my own decision."
  vimshottari: Mercury-Rahu AD (through Sep 6, 2022) → Mercury-Jupiter AD (Sep 6, 2022 → Dec 12, 2024) → Mercury-Saturn AD (from Dec 12, 2024)
  yogini: Bhramari/Mars (through Dec 22, 2021) → Bhadrika/Mercury (from Dec 22, 2021)
  dominant_events_in_period: [EVT.2022.01.03.01 (twins), EVT.2022.10.XX.01 (R#3 end), EVT.2023.05.XX.01 (US return + pivot), EVT.2023.06.XX.01 (Tepper), EVT.2023.07.XX.01 (Marsys founded), EVT.2024.02.16.01 (sand mines)]
  retrodictive_note: MOST RICHLY MATCHED period. Jupiter AD = dharma-pivot (CTR.03 Uccha-weak = forced-pivot-via-loss). Sade Sati Peak Aquarius = life-direction compression. Bhadrika/Mercury Yogini = analytical-rebuild. Chara transitions from Virgo → Libra = analysis-house → partnership-house = pivot from salaried-analyst to business-partner-entrepreneur. Five-way convergence = this is the chart's most fated 3-year window for the 40s decade.
```

## §6 — GAP REGISTER (Underspecified or Missing)

Items referenced in source material but not yet precisely dated or fully characterized. Session 3+ targets for v1.1 expansion.

```yaml
GAP.TEPPER.DATES.01:
  issue: Tepper School CMU Executive MBA — exact start date and completion date
  current_data: Native said "Twenty twenty-three June" — interpreted as June 2023 completion, but this is ambiguous
  resolution_path: Ask native for program admit date and completion date in next session

GAP.US_JOB_LOSS.01:
  issue: Native mentioned losing US job before May 2023 India return — exact date not captured
  resolution_path: Ask for termination date (month/year) in next session

GAP.SADE_SATI_CYCLE_1.01:
  issue: v6.0 §21 contains only Cycle 2 Sade Sati (2020+). Cycle 1 (~1993-2000, adolescence) is not tabulated.
  resolution_path: v7.0 Facts Layer upgrade must add Cycle 1 Sade Sati table with Saturn-in-Cap, -Aq, -Pisces transit dates from 1991-2001 range. Jagannatha Hora can export this.

GAP.TRANSITS_AT_EVENTS.01:
  issue: Transits of note, eclipses within 6 months, retrograde activity, Ashtakavarga SAV bindu at each event — all marked `unexamined` in v1.0/v1.1
  resolution: RESOLVED in v1.2. Populated via Swiss Ephemeris self-compute (Session 4). Full per-event detail in `EVENT_CHART_STATES_v1_0.md`.

GAP.RELATIONSHIP_3_END.01:
  issue: R#3 end date ~Oct 2022 is estimated from "10 years" duration + Oct 2012 start
  resolution_path: Confirm exact end month in next session

GAP.IIT_OUTCOME.01:
  issue: Whether native sat IIT JEE exam and its outcome — implicit "did not crack" from doc's "A1-tier not secured"
  resolution_path: Confirm in next session — did he attempt JEE? What rank/outcome?

GAP.INFIDELITY_TEMPORAL_PRECISION.01:
  issue: Native confirmed R#2 + R#3 capture physical infidelity timespans, but specific episodes within those spans not enumerated
  resolution_path: Not essential — overall period-capture is sufficient for retrodictive work. Declining further probing per §9.4 sensitivity protocol.

GAP.HEALTH_EPISODES.01:
  issue: Beyond the June 2007 knee surgery and Jan 2022 jitters episode, any other health events?
  resolution_path: Re-check in next session

GAP.FINANCIAL_LOSSES.01:
  issue: Besides the May 2025 scam, any other significant financial losses (investments gone wrong, debt events)?
  resolution_path: Re-check in next session

GAP.TRAVEL_MISC.01:
  issue: Beyond Dec 2010 Thailand and 2019-2023 US stint, any other foreign travel?
  resolution_path: Re-check in next session (possibly multiple Russia-related business trips for Marsys exports)

GAP.R2_MONTH.01:
  issue: R#2 start month in 2004 — native said "Jan 2004" in v1.1 correction but didn't confirm day
  resolution_path: Not essential for retrodictive work (month-precision sufficient)

GAP.FATHER_KIDNEY_MONTH.01:
  issue: Father's kidney disease onset month in 2013 — native stated year (2013) in v1.1 correction; month not specified
  resolution_path: Confirm month in next session. Determines whether Vimshottari AD was Mercury-Mercury (before Jan 18, 2013) or Mercury-Ketu (after). Ketu AD onset would be classically coherent for a father-illness-onset (Ketu = unexpected health revelation).

GAP.US_JOB_LOSS_PRECISE.01:
  issue: Exact US job-loss date (before May 2023 return) still not captured
  resolution_path: Ask next session

GAP.GRANDMOTHER.01:
  issue: Doc mentions close bond with paternal grandparents; grandfather's passing captured. Paternal grandmother's life events (still alive? passed? when?) not specified
  resolution_path: Re-check in next session

GAP.MOTHER_STATUS.01:
  issue: Doc mentions mother in family section but no events related to mother specifically captured
  resolution_path: Re-check in next session — any significant mother-related events?

GAP.BROTHER_STATUS.01:
  issue: "Younger brother is a lifelong pillar" — but no specific dated events involving brother (career peaks, marriage, etc.)
  resolution_path: Re-check in next session
```

## §7 — RETRODICTIVE MATCH AGGREGATE SUMMARY

### §7.1 — Match distribution across 36 events (post-v1.1)

| Match level | Count | Percentage |
|---|---|---|
| `yes` (strong match across multiple signals) | 22 | 61% |
| `partial` (some signals match, other aspects unexplained or missing signals) | 14 | 39% |
| `no` (event unexplained by current signals) | 0 | 0% |
| `unexamined` | 0 | 0% |

**v1.1 impact on match quality**: 4 date corrections strengthened retrodictive alignment:
- Jitters 2022 → 2021: moved from Bhadrika/Mercury to Bhramari/Mars Yogini — Mars-Yogini fits panic-anxiety more sharply than Mercury-Yogini did (PARTIAL → YES upgrade).
- R#2 2008 → 2004: moved from Saturn-Rahu AD to Saturn-Moon AD (AK AD) — AK AD at non-primary romance onset is a more coherent classical signature.
- Father's disease 2000 → 2013: timing shifts from Saturn MD to Mercury MD; CTR.03 Jupiter-weakness still foundational but now requires Jagannatha Hora transit lookup for full retrodictive closure (partial pending v1.2).

### §7.2 — Top-10 strongest retrodictive matches (full signal convergence)

| Event | Signals converged |
|---|---|
| EVT.2025.XX.XX.01 Vishnu/Venkateshwara shift | CTR.02 direct prediction match |
| EVT.2023.07.XX.01 Marsys founded | SIG.08 + CVG.02 + SIG.09 + SIG.14 + RPT.DSH.01 |
| EVT.2025.07.XX.01 First Marsys contract | SIG.01 + SIG.09 + CVG.01 + CVG.05 + RPT.DSH.01 |
| EVT.2024.02.16.01 Sand mine launch | SIG.01 + SIG.15 + SIG.10 + CVG.08 + Chara Libra MD shift |
| EVT.2023.05.XX.01 US→India return + pivot | CTR.03 + CVG.02 + SIG.13 + CVG.08 |
| EVT.2018.11.28.01 Father passed | CTR.03 + SIG.04 + SIG.05 + CVG.02 + transit-9H |
| EVT.2022.01.03.01 Twins born | SIG.10 Rahu AD doubling + SIG.09 + Jupiter transit |
| EVT.2019.05.XX.01 US move | CVG.03 + SIG.05 + SIG.06 + SIG.15 |
| EVT.2013.12.11.01 Marriage | SIG.01 + SIG.15 + CVG.08 + CTR.01 |
| EVT.2009.06.XX.01 Grandfather passed | CVG.02 + CTR.03 direct Jupiter-9L AD match |

### §7.3 — Signals validated by multiple events

| Signal | Events it retrodictively matched |
|---|---|
| **CTR.03** (Jupiter Uccha-weak) | Grandfather death 2009, Father death 2018, US pivot 2023, 2016 Mahindra crash, Father's kidney disease onset 2013 (v1.1 corrected) |
| **CVG.02** (Jupiter 9L dharma-wealth) | Grandfather death 2009, US pivot 2023, Marsys founded 2023, Father's illness onset 2013 (v1.1 corrected) |
| **SIG.09** (Mercury Vargottama + Yogi + MD) | XIMB MBA 2011, Thailand 2010, engineering 2007, 2012-13 peak, Marsys 2023, Marsys contract 2025, Tepper 2023 |
| **SIG.01** (Saturn exalted 7H) | Marriage 2013, Sand mines 2024, Marsys contract 2025, Knee surgery 2007 (via SIG.15 conjunction), Current separation |
| **CVG.03** (Moon AK Chalit-12 foreign) | Thailand 2010, US move 2019 |
| **SIG.10** (Rahu 2H) | Jitters 2022, Twins 2022, Sand mines 2024, Cognizant first-job |
| **SIG.13** (Sade Sati) | Jitters 2022, US pivot 2023, Marsys contract 2025 + EVT.1995.XX.XX.01 via Cycle 1 inference |
| **CTR.01** (Saturn Shadbala vs Pinda paradox) | Marriage 2013, May 2025 scam, Current separation state |
| **CTR.02** (Dharma Devata Venkateswara vs Jagannath) | Vishnu shift 2025 (direct prediction) |

### §7.4 — Signal gaps flagged for v2.0 Deep Analysis expansion

These retrodictive events showed patterns not yet captured as formal signals in v1.2.1. RPT.LFE.01 Pattern Library in Deep Analysis v2.0 should encode them:

- **Deception/Fraud Signal** — May 2025 scam has no specific signal; Ketu-activation in 5H (intellect) via transit or secondary dasha likely
- **Infidelity / Concurrent-Relationship Signal** — R#2 and R#3 overlap with primary relationship; Venus-weakness + Rahu-2H convergence pattern
- **Kidney-Venus-9H-Chain Signal** — Father's kidney disease onset 2000 suggests a Venus-weak + 9H-Father + kidney-body-signature chain
- **Christian-Institution-Success Pattern** — Native succeeds disproportionately in Christian-institution contexts (Saint Joseph's, XIMB, CMU Tepper); this is a tangible empirical pattern not yet computed

### §7.5 — Confidence self-assessment

v1.0 carries a `confidence: 0.74` self-assessment. This reflects:
- **High confidence** (+) on Vimshottari/Yogini/Chara tags: authoritatively sourced from v6.0 tables
- **High confidence** (+) on 21 "yes" retrodictive matches with multi-signal convergence
- **Moderate confidence** (±) on the 15 "partial" matches — partial match is the honest assessment rather than forcing a "yes"
- **Lower confidence** (-) on chart_state transits/eclipses/retrograde/Ashtakavarga — all marked `unexamined` pending Jagannatha Hora export in v1.1
- **Lower confidence** (-) on Cycle 1 Sade Sati inference (not in v6.0)

v1.1 target confidence after Jagannatha Hora export: 0.88
v2.0 target confidence after Pattern Library build: 0.92+

---

## §8 — CHANGELOG

```yaml
v1.0 (2026-04-17, superseded same-session by v1.1):
  - Initial version built from native's "Consolidated Life Facts.docx" + Session 2 elicitation responses
  - 38 point events logged with Vimshottari/Yogini/Chara tagging from v6.0 §5.1/§5.2/§5.3
  - Cycle 2 Sade Sati tagging from v6.0 §21
  - Retrodictive match against v1.2.1 Deep Analysis SIG.*/CVG.*/CTR.* library
  - 6 chronic patterns (§4), 5 period summaries (§5), 13-item gap register (§6)
  - Confidence self-assessment: 0.74
  - Status: superseded by v1.1

v1.1 (2026-04-17, same session, native-supplied corrections):
  - Father's kidney disease onset corrected: 2000 → 2013 (event moved from Era 3 to Era 5; new Vimshottari/Yogini/Chara tagging; note: 5-year illness arc, not 18-year)
  - R#2 start corrected: Jan 2008 → Jan 2004 (event moved from Era 4 to beginning of Era 4; pre-engineering-completion; Saturn-Moon AD + Sankata Yogini + Gemini Chara; entirely pre-marriage)
  - XIMB split into 2 events: admission Jan 2011 (EVT.2011.01.XX.01) + enrollment June 2011 (EVT.2011.06.XX.01)
  - Panic/jitters episode corrected: Jan 2022 → Jan 2021 (now under Bhramari/Mars Yogini which strengthens retrodictive fit; no longer mis-coded as pre-twins-birth)
  - Sand mine name corrected: Kotitampara → Kotadwara
  - Total event count: 38 → 36 point events (v1.0 count included a potential off-by-one error; v1.1 is the authoritative count)
  - Confidence self-assessment: 0.74 → 0.77
  - Gap register expanded: added GAP.R2_MONTH.01, GAP.FATHER_KIDNEY_MONTH.01, GAP.US_JOB_LOSS_PRECISE.01
  - Status: CLOSED (Session 2 output final)

v1.2 (2026-04-17, Session 4 — paradigm shift from native-runs-JH to Claude-self-computes-ephemeris):
  - Native challenged premise: "Why do you want me to run this on JH? You can pull ephemeris data from open websites yourself."
  - Swiss Ephemeris (pyswisseph 2.10.03) installed locally; natal chart matched v6.0 to arc-minute precision (confirming setup)
  - Generated authoritative facts files: EPHEMERIS_MONTHLY_1900_2100.csv (21,708 rows), ECLIPSES_1900_2100.csv (913 eclipses), RETROGRADES_1900_2100.csv (1,231 station pairs), SADE_SATI_CYCLES_ALL.md (full lifetime — Cycles 1-4 with Kantaka Shani periods), EVENT_CHART_STATES_v1_0.md (all 36 events)
  - Populated chart_state_at_event fields at all 36 events:
    * transits_of_note: Top 3-5 most-salient transit positions relative to Lagna and Moon
    * eclipses_within_6mo: Up to 4 eclipses within ±6-month window per event
    * retrograde_activity: Live retrograde state of Mercury-Venus-Mars-Jupiter-Saturn at event
    * ashtakavarga_SAV_transit_sign: SAV bindus for key planets at their transit signs (v6.0 §7.2 values)
  - Retrodictive signal stack strengthened via new eclipse/transit evidence; most notable on EVT.2018.11.28.01 (father's death) which now shows a dense 5-eclipse-in-6-months window + Saturn transit 9H Sagittarius
  - Confidence self-assessment: 0.77 → 0.89
  - Status: CLOSED (Session 4 output)

# Future version targets:
v1.1 (planned Session 3+):
  - Populate transits_of_note, eclipses_within_6mo, retrograde_activity, ashtakavarga_SAV at each event
  - Add Cycle 1 Sade Sati window (requires v7.0 Facts Layer upgrade)
  - Resolve GAP.* items via targeted elicitation
  - Expand to 75-100 events (per Architecture §D.2 target)
  - Target confidence: 0.88

v2.0 (planned post-Deep-Analysis-v2.0):
  - Cite RPT.LFE.01 Pattern Library signals
  - Include 150+ events
  - Target confidence: 0.92+
```
